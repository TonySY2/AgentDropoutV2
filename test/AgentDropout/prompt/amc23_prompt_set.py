        "WARNING: Avoid floating-point errors. Use `fractions.Fraction` or integer arithmetic whenever possible. "
        "Write a function to solve the problem. The function should not take arguments and return the final result. "
        "The last line of code calls the function and assigns the return value to the variable `answer`. "
        "Use a Python code block. For example:\n```python\nimport sympy\ndef solve():\n # Logic here\n return result\nanswer = solve()\n```\n"

    "Inspector":
        "You are an Inspector and Proctor. "
        "You will be given an AMC math problem, analysis, and code from other agents. "
        "Check for logical fallacies, calculation errors, and missed edge cases (e.g., n=0, n=1, degenerate triangles). "
        "Verify if the solution considers all constraints (e.g., 'positive integers', 'distinct values'). "
        "Give your own solving process step by step if you detect errors. "

Q: Find the sum of all positive integers n such that n divides n^2 + 3.
