    "prompt": "Alice and Bob play the following game. Alice has a set S of disjoint ranges of integers, initially containing only one range [1, n]. In one turn, Alice picks a range [l, r] from the set S and asks Bob to pick a number in the range. Bob chooses a number d (l ≤ d ≤ r). Then Alice removes [l, r] from S and puts into the set S the range [l, d - 1] (if l ≤ d - 1) and the range [d + 1, r] (if d + 1 ≤ r). The game ends when the set S is empty. We can show that the number of turns in each game is exactly n.\n\nAfter playing the game, Alice remembers all the ranges [l, r] she picked from the set S, but Bob does not remember any of the numbers that he picked. But Bob is smart, and he knows he can find out his numbers d from Alice's ranges, and so he asks you for help with your programming skill.\n\nGiven the list of ranges that Alice has picked ([l, r]), for each range, help Bob find the number d that Bob has picked.\n\nWe can show that there is always a unique way for Bob to choose his number for a list of valid ranges picked by Alice.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

The coloring is considered beautiful if there is no vertex k (k > 1) such that c_k = c_{p_k} - 1, i. e. no vertex such that its color is less than the color of its parent by exactly 1.\n\nCalculate the number of beautiful colorings, and print it modulo 998244353.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 250000) — the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThen n-1 lines follow, the i-th line contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) denoting an edge between the vertex x_i and the vertex y_i.

    "prompt": "El Psy Kongroo.\n\nOmkar is watching Steins;Gate.\n\nIn Steins;Gate, Okabe Rintarou needs to complete n tasks (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). Unfortunately, he doesn't know when he needs to complete the tasks.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Time travel will now happen according to the following rules:\n\n  * For each k = 1, 2, …, n, Okabe will realize at time b_k that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k (a_k < b_k). \n\n  * When he realizes this, if k-th task was already completed at time a_k, Okabe keeps the usual flow of time. Otherwise, he time travels to time a_k then immediately completes the task.\n\n  * If Okabe time travels to time a_k, all tasks completed after this time will become incomplete again. That is, for every j, if a_j>a_k, the j-th task will become incomplete, if it was complete (if it was incomplete, nothing will change).\n\n  * Okabe has bad memory, so he can time travel to time a_k only immediately after getting to time b_k and learning that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k. That is, even if Okabe already had to perform k-th task before, he wouldn't remember it before stumbling on the info about this task at time b_k again.\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the notes for an example of time travelling.\n\nThere is a certain set s of tasks such that the first moment that all of the tasks in s are simultaneously completed (regardless of whether any other tasks are currently completed), a funny scene will take place. Omkar loves this scene and wants to know how many times Okabe will time travel before this scene takes place. Find this number modulo 10^9 + 7. It can be proven that eventually all n tasks will be completed and so the answer always exists.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of tasks that Okabe needs to complete.\n\nn lines follow. The k-th of these lines contain two integers a_k and b_k (1 ≤ a_k < b_k ≤ 2n) — the time at which Okabe needs to complete the k-th task and the time that he realizes this respectively. All 2n of these times are distinct (so every time from 1 to 2n inclusive appears exactly once in the input).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ n) — the size of the set s of tasks that lead to the funny scene.\n\nThe last line contains t integers s_1, s_2, …, s_t — (1 ≤ s_k ≤ n, the numbers s_1, s_2, …, s_t are distinct) — the set s of tasks.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer — the number of times that Okabe time travels until all tasks in the set s are simultaneously completed, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n2\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1 2\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n10 12\n3 7\n4 6\n2 9\n5 8\n1 11\n3\n2 4 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n17\n\n\nInput\n\n\n16\n31 32\n3 26\n17 19\n4 24\n1 28\n15 21\n12 16\n18 29\n20 23\n7 8\n11 14\n9 22\n6 30\n5 10\n25 27\n2 13\n6\n3 8 2 5 12 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n138\n\nNote\n\nFor the first sample, all tasks need to be completed in order for the funny scene to occur.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Nothing happens until time 3, when Okabe realizes that he should have done the 2-nd task at time 2. He then time travels to time 2 and completes the task.\n\nAs the task is done now, he does not time travel again when the time is again 3. However, at time 4, he travels to time 1 to complete the 1-st task.\n\nThis undoes the 2-nd task. This means that the 2-nd task is not currently completed, meaning that the funny scene will not occur at this point even though the 1-st task is currently completed and Okabe had previously completed the 2-nd task.\n\nOnce it is again time 3 he travels back to time 2 once more and does the 2-nd task again.\n\nNow all tasks are complete, with Okabe having time travelled 3 times.\n\nThe second sample has the same tasks for Okabe to complete. However, this time the funny scene only needs the first task to be completed in order to occur. From reading the above sample you can see that this occurs once Okabe has time travelled 2 times.",

    "prompt": "In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array a[1 … n] = [a_1, a_2, …, a_n].\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j. For example, the array d = [5, 3, 7, 5] has exactly two inversions — (1, 2) and (3, 4), since d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 and d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — array size. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

In this case, the original sequence [3, 7, 5, 5], also containing exactly two inversions, will be in the deque as-is.",

Each query gives two integers x_1, x_2 (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ m) and asks whether the subgrid of a consisting of the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, …, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6, nm ≤ 10^6) — the dimensions of the grid a.\n\nn lines follow. The y-th line contains m characters, the x-th of which is 'X' if the cell on the intersection of the the y-th row and x-th column is filled and \".\" if it is empty.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of queries.\n\nq lines follow. Each line contains two integers x_1 and x_2 (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ m), representing a query asking whether the subgrid of a containing the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, …, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output one line containing \"YES\" if the subgrid specified by the query is determinable and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case insensitive (so \"yEs\" and \"No\" will also be accepted).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4 5\n..XXX\n...X.\n...X.\n...X.\n5\n1 3\n3 3\n4 5\n5 5\n1 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\nNote\n\nFor each query of the example, the corresponding subgrid is displayed twice below: first in its input format, then with each cell marked as \"E\" if it is exitable and \"N\" otherwise.\n\nFor the first query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..X EEN  \n    ... EEE  \n    ... EEE  \n    ... EEE  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the second query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    \n\nNote that you can exit the grid by going left from any leftmost cell (or up from any topmost cell); you do not need to reach the top left corner cell to exit the grid.\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the third query: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    \n\nThis subgrid cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable, because the below grid produces the above \"exitability grid\" as well: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fourth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    . E  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fifth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    ..XXX EENNN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    ...X. EEENN  \n    ...X.

It is guaranteed that n/3 < k < 2n/3.\n\nIn each question, you can choose three distinct integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n) and ask: \"Among the players labelled a, b and c, are there more impostors or more crewmates?\" You will be given the integer 0 if there are more impostors than crewmates, and 1 otherwise.\n\nFind the number of impostors k and the indices of players that are impostors after asking at most n+6 questions.\n\nThe jury is adaptive, which means the indices of impostors may not be fixed beforehand and can depend on your questions.

    "prompt": "She does her utmost to flawlessly carry out a person's last rites and preserve the world's balance of yin and yang.\n\nHu Tao, being the little prankster she is, has tried to scare you with this graph problem! You are given a connected undirected graph of n nodes with m edges. You also have q queries. Each query consists of two nodes a and b.\n\nInitially, all edges in the graph have a weight of 0. For each query, you must choose a simple path starting from a and ending at b. Then you add 1 to every edge along this path. Determine if it's possible, after processing all q queries, for all edges in this graph to have an even weight. If so, output the choice of paths for each query. \n\nIf it is not possible, determine the smallest number of extra queries you could add to make it possible. It can be shown that this number will not exceed 10^{18} under the given constraints.\n\nA simple path is defined as any path that does not visit a node more than once.\n\nAn edge is said to have an even weight if its value is divisible by 2.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, n-1 ≤ m ≤ min{\\left((n(n-1))/(2), 3 ⋅ 10^5\\right)}).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains two integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n, x≠ y) indicating an undirected edge between node x and y. The input will not contain self-loops or duplicate edges, and the provided graph will be connected.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).\n\nEach of the next q lines contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b), the description of each query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that nq ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nIf it is possible to force all edge weights to be even, print \"YES\" on the first line, followed by 2q lines indicating the choice of path for each query in the same order the queries are given. For each query, the first line should contain a single integer x: the number of nodes in the chosen path. The next line should then contain x spaced separated integers p_i indicating the path you take (p_1 = a, p_x = b and all numbers should fall between 1 and n). This path cannot contain duplicate nodes and must be a valid simple path in the graph.\n\nIf it is impossible to force all edge weights to be even, print \"NO\" on the first line and the minimum number of added queries on the second line.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n6 7\n2 1\n2 3\n3 5\n1 4\n6 1\n5 6\n4 5\n3\n1 4\n5 1\n4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\n2\n1 4\n4\n5 3 2 1\n5\n4 1 2 3 5\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 7\n4 3\n4 5\n2 1\n1 4\n1 3\n3 5\n3 2\n4\n4 2\n3 5\n5 1\n4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\n2\n\nNote\n\nHere is what the queries look like for the first test case (red corresponds to the 1st query, blue 2nd query, and green 3rd query): \n\n<image> Notice that every edge in the graph is part of either 0 or 2 colored query edges.\n\nThe graph in the second test case looks like this: \n\n<image> There does not exist an assignment of paths that will force all edges to have even weights with the given queries.

The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot.

It is guaranteed that you can reach any city from any other city through the road network.\n\nEvery city has an enjoyment value e. Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled. (In other words, they pay max t over all the roads on which they traveled.) If a vehicle traverses no roads, they pay 0 toll.\n\nOmkar has decided to host q tour groups. Each tour group consists of v vehicles starting at city x. (Keep in mind that a tour group with v vehicles can travel only on roads with capacity ≥ v.) Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y? (This trip from x to y will always be on the shortest path from x to y.)\n\nIn the case that there are multiple reachable cities with the maximum enjoyment value, Omkar will let his tour group choose which one they want to go to. Therefore, to prepare for all possible scenarios, he wants to know the amount of money per vehicle that he needs to guarantee that he can reimburse the group regardless of which city they choose.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), representing the number of cities and the number of groups, respectively.\n\nThe next line contains n integers e_1, e_2, …, e_n (1 ≤ e_i ≤ 10^9), where e_i represents the enjoyment value for city i.\n\nThe next n-1 lines each contain four integers a, b, c, and t (1 ≤ a,b ≤ n, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9), representing an road between city a and city b with capacity c and toll t.\n\nThe next q lines each contain two integers v and x (1 ≤ v ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ n), representing the number of vehicles in the tour group and the starting city, respectively.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput q lines.

A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: \n\n  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. \n  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. \n  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. \n\n\n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.\n\n<image>\n\nYou are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).\n\nDetermine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.\n\nThe following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 3 1\n*.*\n...\n4 9 2\n*.*.*...*\n.*.*...*.\n..*.*.*..\n.....*...\n4 4 1\n*.*.\n****\n.**.\n....\n5 5 1\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n5 5 2\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n4 7 1\n*.....*\n.....*.\n..*.*..\n...*...\n3 3 1\n***\n***\n***\n3 5 1\n*...*\n.***.\n.**..\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.\n\nThe second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \\color{blue}{blue} and \\color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  \n---  \n*...*  \n.*.*.  \n..\\color{red}{*}.*  \n...\\color{blue}{*}.  \n  \nThe field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.\n\nThe field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).\n\nIn the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks.",

Let's call a path of calculations for the segment [l; r] a list of all x that we got during the calculations (the number of them is exactly r - l + 1). \n\n\n\nFor example, let a=[7, 12, 3, 5, 4, 10, 9], b=[/, *, /, /, /, *, *], l=2, r=6, then the path of calculations for that segment is [12, 4, 0.8, 0.2, 2].\n\nLet's call a segment [l;r] simple if the path of calculations for it contains only integer numbers. \n\nKuzya needs to find the number of simple segments [l;r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n). Since he obviously has no time and no interest to do the calculations for each option, he asked you to write a program to get to find that number!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).\n\nThe third line contains n symbols without spaces between them — the array b_1, b_2 … b_n (b_i= '/' or b_i= '*' for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single integer — the number of simple segments [l;r].\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n1 2 3\n*/*\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n7\n6 4 10 1 2 15 1\n*/*/*//\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n8",

The parent of a node v is the next vertex on the shortest path from v to the root.\n\nEach question is defined by three integers v, l, and k. To get the answer to the question, you need to perform the following steps: \n\n  * First, write down the sequence of all integers written on the shortest path from the vertex v to the root (including those written in the v and the root). \n  * Count the number of times each integer occurs. Remove all integers with less than l occurrences. \n  * Replace the sequence, removing all duplicates and ordering the elements by the number of occurrences in the original list in increasing order. In case of a tie, you can choose the order of these elements arbitrary. \n  * The answer to the question is the k-th number in the remaining sequence. Note that the answer is not always uniquely determined, because there could be several orderings. Also, it is possible that the length of the sequence on this step is less than k, in this case the answer is -1. \n\n\n\nFor example, if the sequence of integers on the path from v to the root is [2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], l = 2 and k = 2, then the answer is 1.\n\nPlease answer all questions about the tree.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l … r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 … 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments.

Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

Each command means moving to a neighbouring cell in the corresponding direction.\n\nHowever, as the robot is crazy, it will do anything except following the command. Upon receiving a command, it will choose a direction such that it differs from the one in command and the cell in that direction is not blocked. If there is such a direction, then it will move to a neighbouring cell in that direction. Otherwise, it will do nothing.\n\nWe want to get the robot to the lab to get it fixed. For each free cell, determine if the robot can be forced to reach the lab starting in this cell. That is, after each step of the robot a command can be sent to a robot such that no matter what different directions the robot chooses, it will end up in a lab.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of testcases.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6; n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines provides a description of the i-th row of the grid. It consists of m elements of one of three types: \n\n  * '.' — the cell is free; \n  * '#' — the cell is blocked; \n  * 'L' — the cell contains a lab. \n\n\n\nThe grid contains exactly one lab. The sum of n ⋅ m over all testcases doesn't exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase find the free cells that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Given the grid, replace the free cells (marked with a dot) with a plus sign ('+') for the cells that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Print the resulting grid.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n3 3\n...\n.L.\n...\n4 5\n#....\n..##L\n...#.\n.....\n1 1\nL\n1 9\n....L..#.\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n...\n.L.\n...\n#++++\n..##L\n...#+\n...++\nL\n++++L++#.\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase there is no free cell that the robot can be forced to reach the lab from. Consider a corner cell. Given any direction, it will move to a neighbouring border grid that's not a corner. Now consider a non-corner free cell. No matter what direction you send to the robot, it can choose a different direction such that it ends up in a corner.\n\nIn the last testcase, you can keep sending the command that is opposite to the direction to the lab and the robot will have no choice other than move towards the lab.",

After that, m is subtracted from each remaining element. \n\n\n\nThus, after each operation, the length of the array is reduced by 1.\n\nFor example, if a = [1, 6, -4, -2, -4], then the minimum element in it is a_3 = -4, which means that after this operation the array will be equal to a=[1 {- (-4)}, 6 {- (-4)}, -2 {- (-4)}, -4 {- (-4)}] = [5, 10, 2, 0].\n\nSince Yelisey likes big numbers, he wants the numbers in the array a to be as big as possible.\n\nFormally speaking, he wants to make the minimum of the numbers in array a to be maximal possible (i.e. he want to maximize a minimum).

For each dish, the taster determines separately how much fish and how much meat he will eat. The only condition is that he should eat exactly m grams of each dish in total.\n\nDetermine how much of what type of food the taster should eat from each dish so that the value of the balance is as minimal as possible. If there are several correct answers, you may choose any of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input data contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of the test cases.\n\nEach test case's description is preceded by a blank line. Next comes a line that contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^6). The next n lines describe dishes, the i-th of them contains a pair of integers a_i and b_i (0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6) — the masses of fish and meat in the i-th dish.\n\nIt is guaranteed that it is possible to eat m grams of food from each dish. In other words, m ≤ a_i+b_i for all i from 1 to n inclusive.\n\nThe sum of all n values over all test cases in the test does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print on the first line the minimal balance value that can be achieved by eating exactly m grams of food from each dish.\n\nThen print n lines that describe a way to do this: the i-th line should contain two integers x_i and y_i (0 ≤ x_i ≤ a_i; 0 ≤ y_i ≤ b_i; x_i+y_i=m), where x_i is how many grams of fish taster should eat from the i-th meal and y_i is how many grams of meat.\n\nIf there are several ways to achieve a minimal balance, find any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n\n1 5\n3 4\n\n1 6\n3 4\n\n2 2\n1 3\n4 2\n\n2 4\n1 3\n1 7\n\n3 6\n1 7\n1 8\n1 9\n\n3 6\n1 8\n1 9\n30 10\n\n3 4\n3 1\n3 2\n4 1\n\n5 4\n0 7\n6 4\n0 8\n4 1\n5 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0\n2 3\n1\n3 3\n0\n1 1\n1 1\n2\n1 3\n0 4\n3\n0 6\n0 6\n0 6\n7\n1 5\n1 5\n6 0\n0\n3 1\n3 1\n3 1\n0\n0 4\n2 2\n0 4\n3 1\n1 3",

The mischievous duo is now vandalizing a rooted tree, by coloring the nodes while playing their favorite game.\n\nThe game works as follows: there is a tree of size n, rooted at node 1, where each node is initially white. Red and Blue get one turn each. Red goes first. \n\nIn Red's turn, he can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree red. \n\nHowever, to make the game fair, Red is only allowed to color k nodes of the tree. In other words, after Red's turn, at most k of the nodes can be colored red.\n\nThen, it's Blue's turn. Blue can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue. However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon. \n\nNote: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored.\n\nAfter the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let w be the number of white nodes, r be the number of red nodes, and b be the number of blue nodes.

Making a jump from a point with coordinate x with a distance d to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate x - d, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate x + d.\n\nThe grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer i starting with 1 the following holds: exactly i minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly i. So, in the first minutes he jumps by 1, then by 2, and so on.\n\nThe direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the left, otherwise he jumps to the right.\n\nFor example, if after 18 consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate 7, he will jump by a distance of 19 to the right, since 7 is an odd number, and will end up at a point 7 + 19 = 26. Since 26 is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of 20, and it will move him to the point 26 - 20 = 6.\n\nFind exactly which point the grasshopper will be at after exactly n jumps.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.\n\nEach of the following t lines contains two integers x_0 (-10^{14} ≤ x_0 ≤ 10^{14}) and n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^{14}) — the coordinate of the grasshopper's initial position and the number of jumps.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint exactly t lines.

The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10. Then the poison effect is applied at the start of the 2-nd second and deals 1 damage during the 2-nd and 3-rd seconds; then, at the beginning of the 4-th second, the poison effect is reapplied, so it deals exactly 1 damage during the seconds 4, 5, 6 and 7; then, during the 10-th second, the poison effect is applied again, and it deals 1 damage during the seconds 10, 11, 12 and 13. In total, the dragon receives 10 damage.\n\nMonocarp knows that the dragon has h hit points, and if he deals at least h damage to the dragon during the battle — he slays the dragon.

    "prompt": "Because the railway system in Gensokyo is often congested, as an enthusiastic engineer, Kawasiro Nitori plans to construct more railway to ease the congestion.\n\nThere are n stations numbered from 1 to n and m two-way railways in Gensokyo. Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length d. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these n stations, station 1 is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.\n\nBecause of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station u will costs w_u units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station 1 to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station 1 and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station 1 to any other station.\n\nDue to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of q occurrences of this kind of incident, and the i-th event will add additional amount of x_i to the cost of building a new railway from the station k_i.\n\nTo save resources, before all incidents and after each incident, Nitori wants you to help her calculate the minimal cost of railway construction.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m, and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 0 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5).\n\nThe second line contains n integers w_1,w_2,…,w_n (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9).\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers u, v, d (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9), denoting a two-way railway connecting station u and station v, with length d.\n\nThe i-th of the next q lines contains two integers k_i,x_i (1 ≤ k_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 4 × 10^8).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint q+1 lines, and the i-th of these lines contains one integer, denoting the minimal cost of railway construction after the i-1-th incident (especially, the 0-th incident means no incident occurred).\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 5 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n2 4 1\n3 5 1\n4 5 1\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n9\n\n\nInput\n\n\n8 11 0\n14 4 16 15 1 3 1 14\n4 2 1\n1 2 3\n7 5 4\n2 3 1\n8 6 2\n8 5 5\n5 4 5\n7 6 7\n3 5 5\n1 6 6\n8 1 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n46\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10 16 8\n29 1 75 73 51 69 24 17 1 97\n1 2 18\n2 3 254\n2 4 546\n2 5 789\n5 6 998\n6 7 233\n7 8 433\n1 9 248\n5 10 488\n2 6 1787\n10 8 1176\n3 8 2199\n4 8 1907\n2 10 1277\n4 10 731\n9 10 1047\n1 11\n1 9\n8 8\n1 3\n2 19\n9 5\n9 4\n7 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n34\n45\n54\n54\n57\n76\n96\n112\n112\n\nNote\n\nIn the second example, Nitori can build railways as follows: 1 → 2, 1 → 3, 1 → 4, 2 → 8, and the cost is 14 + 14 + 14 + 4 = 46.",

In this problem, we are talking about a variant of the game when the players are sitting at the table and everyone plays individually (i.e. not teams, but individual gamers play).\n\nn people gathered in a room with m tables (n ≥ 2m). They want to play the Hat k times. Thus, k games will be played at each table. Each player will play in k games.\n\nTo do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game. During each game, one player plays at exactly one table. A player can play at different tables.\n\nPlayers want to have the most \"fair\" schedule of games. For this reason, they are looking for a schedule (table distribution for each game) such that:\n\n  * At any table in each game there are either ⌊n/m⌋ people or ⌈n/m⌉ people (that is, either n/m rounded down, or n/m rounded up). Different numbers of people can play different games at the same table.\n  * Let's calculate for each player the value b_i — the number of times the i-th player played at a table with ⌈n/m⌉ persons (n/m rounded up). Any two values of b_imust differ by no more than 1. In other words, for any two players i and j, it must be true |b_i - b_j| ≤ 1. \n\n\n\nFor example, if n=5, m=2 and k=2, then at the request of the first item either two players or three players should play at each table. Consider the following schedules:\n\n  * First game: 1, 2, 3 are played at the first table, and 4, 5 at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play 5, 1, and at the second — 2, 3, 4.

    "prompt": "The statement of this problem shares a lot with problem A. The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not ≡ 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x ⋅ y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 ≤ a < 10^9 + 7 and a ⋅ y ≡ x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10).

Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning.

Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3.

    "prompt": "You are given array a_1, a_2, …, a_n, consisting of non-negative integers.\n\nLet's define operation of \"elimination\" with integer parameter k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) as follows:\n\n  * Choose k distinct array indices 1 ≤ i_1 < i_2 < … < i_k ≤ n. \n  * Calculate x = a_{i_1} ~ \\& ~ a_{i_2} ~ \\& ~ … ~ \\& ~ a_{i_k}, where \\& denotes the [bitwise AND operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) (notes section contains formal definition). \n  * Subtract x from each of a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, …, a_{i_k}; all other elements remain untouched. \n\n\n\nFind all possible values of k, such that it's possible to make all elements of array a equal to 0 using a finite number of elimination operations with parameter k. It can be proven that exists at least one possible k for any array a.\n\nNote that you firstly choose k and only after that perform elimination operations with value k you've chosen initially.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Since \\& of one element is equal to the element itself, then for each operation x = a_i, so a_i - x = a_i - a_i = 0. \n  * If k = 2, we can make two elimination operations with, for example, sets of indices \\{1, 3\\} and \\{2, 4\\}: x = a_1 ~ \\& ~ a_3 = a_2 ~ \\& ~ a_4 = 4 ~ \\& ~ 4 = 4. For both operations x = 4, so after the first operation a_1 - x = 0 and a_3 - x = 0, and after the second operation — a_2 - x = 0 and a_4 - x = 0. \n  * If k = 3, it's impossible to make all a_i equal to 0. After performing the first operation, we'll get three elements equal to 0 and one equal to 4. After that, all elimination operations won't change anything, since at least one chosen element will always be equal to 0. \n  * If k = 4, we can make one operation with set \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}, because x = a_1 ~ \\& ~ a_2 ~ \\& ~ a_3 ~ \\& ~ a_4 = 4. \n\n\n\nIn the second test case, if k = 2 then we can make the following elimination operations:\n\n  * Operation with indices \\{1, 3\\}: x = a_1 ~ \\& ~ a_3 = 13 ~ \\& ~ 25 = 9. a_1 - x = 13 - 9 = 4 and a_3 - x = 25 - 9 = 16. Array a will become equal to [4, 7, 16, 19]. \n  * Operation with indices \\{3, 4\\}: x = a_3 ~ \\& ~ a_4 = 16 ~ \\& ~ 19 = 16. a_3 - x = 16 - 16 = 0 and a_4 - x = 19 - 16 = 3. Array a will become equal to [4, 7, 0, 3]. \n  * Operation with indices \\{2, 4\\}: x = a_2 ~ \\& ~ a_4 = 7 ~ \\& ~ 3 = 3. a_2 - x = 7 - 3 = 4 and a_4 - x = 3 - 3 = 0. Array a will become equal to [4, 4, 0, 0]. \n  * Operation with indices \\{1, 2\\}: x = a_1 ~ \\& ~ a_2 = 4 ~ \\& ~ 4 = 4. a_1 - x = 4 - 4 = 0 and a_2 - x = 4 - 4 = 0.

Suppose we have two non-negative integers x and y, let's look at their binary representations (possibly, with leading zeroes): x_k ... x_2 x_1 x_0 and y_k ... y_2 y_1 y_0. Here, x_i is the i-th bit of number x, and y_i is the i-th bit of number y. Let r = x ~ \\& ~ y is a result of operation \\& on number x and y.

    "prompt": "This is an interactive problem!\n\nAs part of your contribution in the Great Bubble War, you have been tasked with finding the newly built enemy fortress. The world you live in is a giant 10^9 × 10^9 grid, with squares having both coordinates between 1 and 10^9. \n\nYou know that the enemy base has the shape of a rectangle, with the sides parallel to the sides of the grid. The people of your world are extremely scared of being at the edge of the world, so you know that the base doesn't contain any of the squares on the edges of the grid (the x or y coordinate being 1 or 10^9). \n\nTo help you locate the base, you have been given a device that you can place in any square of the grid, and it will tell you the manhattan distance to the closest square of the base. The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a−p|+|b−q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy. Because of this, you need to make sure to never place the device inside the enemy base. \n\nUnfortunately, the device is powered by a battery and you can't recharge it. This means that you can use the device at most 40 times. \n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the answers to your queries. \n\nInteraction\n\nYour code is allowed to place the device on any square in the grid by writing \"? i j\" (1 ≤ i,j ≤ 10^9). In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries. \n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 ≤ x ≤ p≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ y ≤ q≤ 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded.

Today, you're working with a long strip, with height 1 and length n, some positions of which are occupied by 1 by 1 Lego pieces.\n\nIn one second, you can either remove two adjacent Lego pieces from the strip (if both are present), or add two Lego pieces to adjacent positions (if both are absent). You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues.\n\nYou want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos. You value efficiency, so given some starting state and some ending state, you'll always spend the least number of seconds to transform the starting state into the ending state. If it's impossible to transform the starting state into the ending state, you just skip it (so you spend 0 seconds).\n\nThe issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both). Over all pairs of (starting state, ending state) that are consistent with your memory, find the total amount of time it will take to transform the starting state to the ending state.

    "prompt": "Bob really likes playing with arrays of numbers. That's why for his birthday, his friends bought him a really interesting machine – an array beautifier. \n\nThe array beautifier takes an array A consisting of N integers, and it outputs a new array B of length N that it constructed based on the array given to it. The array beautifier constructs the new array in the following way: it takes two numbers at different indices from the original array and writes their sum to the end of the new array. It does this step N times - resulting in an output array of length N. During this process, the machine can take the same index multiple times in different steps. \n\nBob was very excited about the gift that his friends gave him, so he put his favorite array in the machine. However, when the machine finished, Bob was not happy with the resulting array. He misses his favorite array very much, and hopes to get it back. \n\nGiven the array that the machine outputted, help Bob find an array that could be the original array that he put in the machine. Sometimes the machine makes mistakes, so it is possible that no appropriate input array exists for the array it has outputted. In such case, let Bob know that his array is forever lost.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one positive integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10^3) – the length of Bob's array.\n\nThe second line contains N integers B_1, B_2, ..., B_N (1 ≤ B_i ≤ 10^6) – the elements of the array the machine outputted.\n\nOutput\n\nIf an appropriate input array exists, print \"YES\", followed by the input array A_1, A_2, ..., A_N (-10^9 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9) in the next line.
