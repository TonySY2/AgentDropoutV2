Unfortunately, he doesn't know when he needs to complete the tasks.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Time travel will now happen according to the following rules:\n\n  * For each k = 1, 2, …, n, Okabe will realize at time b_k that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k (a_k < b_k). \n\n  * When he realizes this, if k-th task was already completed at time a_k, Okabe keeps the usual flow of time. Otherwise, he time travels to time a_k then immediately completes the task.\n\n  * If Okabe time travels to time a_k, all tasks completed after this time will become incomplete again. That is, for every j, if a_j>a_k, the j-th task will become incomplete, if it was complete (if it was incomplete, nothing will change).\n\n  * Okabe has bad memory, so he can time travel to time a_k only immediately after getting to time b_k and learning that he was supposed to complete the k-th task at time a_k. That is, even if Okabe already had to perform k-th task before, he wouldn't remember it before stumbling on the info about this task at time b_k again.\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the notes for an example of time travelling.\n\nThere is a certain set s of tasks such that the first moment that all of the tasks in s are simultaneously completed (regardless of whether any other tasks are currently completed), a funny scene will take place. Omkar loves this scene and wants to know how many times Okabe will time travel before this scene takes place. Find this number modulo 10^9 + 7. It can be proven that eventually all n tasks will be completed and so the answer always exists.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of tasks that Okabe needs to complete.\n\nn lines follow. The k-th of these lines contain two integers a_k and b_k (1 ≤ a_k < b_k ≤ 2n) — the time at which Okabe needs to complete the k-th task and the time that he realizes this respectively. All 2n of these times are distinct (so every time from 1 to 2n inclusive appears exactly once in the input).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ n) — the size of the set s of tasks that lead to the funny scene.\n\nThe last line contains t integers s_1, s_2, …, s_t — (1 ≤ s_k ≤ n, the numbers s_1, s_2, …, s_t are distinct) — the set s of tasks.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer — the number of times that Okabe time travels until all tasks in the set s are simultaneously completed, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n2\n1 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 4\n2 3\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1 2\n1\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n10 12\n3 7\n4 6\n2 9\n5 8\n1 11\n3\n2 4 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n17\n\n\nInput\n\n\n16\n31 32\n3 26\n17 19\n4 24\n1 28\n15 21\n12 16\n18 29\n20 23\n7 8\n11 14\n9 22\n6 30\n5 10\n25 27\n2 13\n6\n3 8 2 5 12 11\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n138\n\nNote\n\nFor the first sample, all tasks need to be completed in order for the funny scene to occur.\n\nInitially, the time is 0. Nothing happens until time 3, when Okabe realizes that he should have done the 2-nd task at time 2. He then time travels to time 2 and completes the task.\n\nAs the task is done now, he does not time travel again when the time is again 3. However, at time 4, he travels to time 1 to complete the 1-st task.\n\nThis undoes the 2-nd task. This means that the 2-nd task is not currently completed, meaning that the funny scene will not occur at this point even though the 1-st task is currently completed and Okabe had previously completed the 2-nd task.\n\nOnce it is again time 3 he travels back to time 2 once more and does the 2-nd task again.\n\nNow all tasks are complete, with Okabe having time travelled 3 times.\n\nThe second sample has the same tasks for Okabe to complete. However, this time the funny scene only needs the first task to be completed in order to occur. From reading the above sample you can see that this occurs once Okabe has time travelled 2 times."

    "prompt": "In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.\n\nYou are given an integer array a[1 … n] = [a_1, a_2, …, a_n].\n\nLet us consider an empty [deque](https://tinyurl.com/pfeucbux) (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j. For example, the array d = [5, 3, 7, 5] has exactly two inversions — (1, 2) and (3, 4), since d_1 = 5 > 3 = d_2 and d_3 = 7 > 5 = d_4.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — array size. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer — the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after executing the described algorithm.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n4\n3 7 5 5\n3\n3 2 1\n3\n3 1 2\n4\n-1 2 2 -1\n4\n4 5 1 3\n5\n1 3 1 3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n\nNote\n\nOne of the ways to get the sequence [5, 3, 7, 5] in the deque, containing only two inversions, from the initial array [3, 7, 5, 5] (the first sample test case) is described in the problem statement. \n\nAlso, in this example, you could get the answer of two inversions by simply putting each element of the original array at the end of the deque. In this case, the original sequence [3, 7, 5, 5], also containing exactly two inversions, will be in the deque as-is."

    "prompt": "It turns out that the meaning of life is a permutation p_1, p_2, …, p_n of the integers 1, 2, …, n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). Omkar, having created all life, knows this permutation, and will allow you to figure it out using some queries.\n\nA query consists of an array a_1, a_2, …, a_n of integers between 1 and n. a is not required to be a permutation. Omkar will first compute the pairwise sum of a and p, meaning that he will compute an array s where s_j = p_j + a_j for all j = 1, 2, …, n. Then, he will find the smallest index k such that s_k occurs more than once in s, and answer with k. If there is no such index k, then he will answer with 0.\n\nYou can perform at most 2n queries. Figure out the meaning of life p.\n\nInteraction\n\nStart the interaction by reading single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the permutation p.\n\nYou can then make queries. A query consists of a single line \"? \\enspace a_1 \\enspace a_2 \\enspace … \\enspace a_n\" (1 ≤ a_j ≤ n).\n\nThe answer to each query will be a single integer k as described above (0 ≤ k ≤ n).\n\nAfter making a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n  * System.out.flush() in Java;\n  * flush(output) in Pascal;\n  * stdout.flush() in Python;\n  * see documentation for other languages.\n\n\n\nTo output your answer, print a single line \"! \\enspace p_1 \\enspace p_2 \\enspace … \\enspace p_n\" then terminate.\n\nYou can make at most 2n queries. Outputting the answer does not count as a query.\n\nHack Format\n\nTo hack, first output a line containing n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), then output another line containing the hidden permutation p_1, p_2, …, p_n of numbers from 1 to n.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n? 4 4 2 3 2\n\n? 3 5 1 5 5\n\n? 5 2 4 3 1\n\n! 3 2 1 5 4\n\nNote\n\nIn the sample, the hidden permutation p is [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]. Three queries were made.\n\nThe first query is a = [4, 4, 2, 3, 2]. This yields s = [3 + 4, 2 + 4, 1 + 2, 5 + 3, 4 + 2] = [7, 6, 3, 8, 6]. 6 is the only number that appears more than once, and it appears first at index 2, making the answer to the query 2.\n\nThe second query is a = [3, 5, 1, 5, 5]. This yields s = [3 + 3, 2 + 5, 1 + 1, 5 + 5, 4 + 5] = [6, 7, 2, 10, 9]. There are no numbers that appear more than once here, so the answer to the query is 0.\n\nThe third query is a = [5, 2, 4, 3, 1]. This yields s = [3 + 5, 2 + 2, 1 + 4, 5 + 3, 4 + 1] = [8, 4, 5, 8, 5]. 5 and 8 both occur more than once here. 5 first appears at index 3, while 8 first appears at index 1, and 1 < 3, making the answer to the query 1.\n\nNote that the sample is only meant to provide an example of how the interaction works; it is not guaranteed that the above queries represent a correct strategy with which to determine the answer."

His favorite game is Bubble Strike, fast-paced bubble shooting online game for two players.\n\nEach game is set in one of the N maps, each having different terrain configuration. First phase of each game decides on which map the game will be played. The game system randomly selects three maps and shows them to the players. Each player must pick one of those three maps to be discarded. The game system then randomly selects one of the maps that were not picked by any of the players and starts the game.\n\nJohnny is deeply enthusiastic about the game and wants to spend some time studying maps, thus increasing chances to win games played on those maps. However, he also needs to do his homework, so he does not have time to study all the maps. That is why he asked himself the following question: \"What is the minimum number of maps I have to study, so that the probability to play one of those maps is at least P\"?\n\nCan you help Johnny find the answer for this question? You can assume Johnny's opponents do not know him, and they will randomly pick maps.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N (3 ≤ N ≤ 10^{3}) and P (0 ≤ P ≤ 1) – total number of maps in the game and probability to play map Johnny has studied.

Each road has a capacity c, denoting the maximum number of vehicles that can be on it, and an associated toll t. However, the toll system in Omkarland has an interesting quirk: if a vehicle travels on multiple roads on a single journey, they pay only the highest toll of any single road on which they traveled.

Being the tour organizer, Omkar wants his groups to have as much fun as they possibly can, but also must reimburse his groups for the tolls that they have to pay. Thus, for each tour group, Omkar wants to know two things: first, what is the enjoyment value of the city y with maximum enjoyment value that the tour group can reach from their starting city, and second, how much per vehicle will Omkar have to pay to reimburse the entire group for their trip from x to y?

Thus, the largest reachable enjoyment value is still 3, and Omkar will pay 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 6 starting at city 2 can reach cities 2 and 4. The largest reachable enjoyment value is again 3. If the tour group chooses to go to city 4, Omkar will have to pay 2 per vehicle, which is the maximum.\n\nA map of the second sample is shown below:\n\n<image>\n\nFor the first query, a tour group of size 5 starting at city 1 can only reach city 1. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 1 and the cost Omkar will have to pay is 0 per vehicle.\n\nFor the second query, a tour group of size 4 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1 and 2. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 2 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the third query, a tour group of size 3 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, and 3. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 3 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fourth query, a tour group of size 2 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, their maximum enjoyment value is 4 and Omkar will pay 1 per vehicle.\n\nFor the fifth query, a tour group of size 1 starting at city 1 can reach cities 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

If there can be several answers, print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n1 3 4 4 5 7 8\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n300000000 300000000 300000000 600000000 600000000 600000000 900000000\n1 1 2 999999998 999999999 999999999 1000000000\n1 2 2 3 3 4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1 4 3\n4 1 2\n300000000 300000000 300000000\n999999998 1 1\n1 2 2\n\nNote\n\nThe subsequence of the array a is a sequence that can be obtained from a by removing zero or more of its elements.\n\nTwo subsequences are considered different if index sets of elements included in them are different.

    "prompt": "Casimir has a rectangular piece of paper with a checkered field of size n × m. Initially, all cells of the field are white.\n\nLet us denote the cell with coordinates i vertically and j horizontally by (i, j). The upper left cell will be referred to as (1, 1) and the lower right cell as (n, m).\n\nCasimir draws ticks of different sizes on the field. A tick of size d (d > 0) with its center in cell (i, j) is drawn as follows: \n\n  1. First, the center cell (i, j) is painted black. \n  2. Then exactly d cells on the top-left diagonally to the center and exactly d cells on the top-right diagonally to the center are also painted black. \n  3. That is all the cells with coordinates (i - h, j ± h) for all h between 0 and d are painted. In particular, a tick consists of 2d + 1 black cells. \n\n\n\nAn already painted cell will remain black if painted again. Below you can find an example of the 4 × 9 box, with two ticks of sizes 2 and 3.\n\n<image>\n\nYou are given a description of a checkered field of size n × m. Casimir claims that this field came about after he drew some (possibly 0) ticks on it. The ticks could be of different sizes, but the size of each tick is at least k (that is, d ≥ k for all the ticks).\n\nDetermine whether this field can indeed be obtained by drawing some (possibly none) ticks of sizes d ≥ k or not.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number test cases.\n\nThe following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of the test case description contains the integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10; 1 ≤ m ≤ 19) — the field size and the minimum size of the ticks that Casimir drew. The following n lines describe the field: each line consists of m characters either being '.' if the corresponding cell is not yet painted or '*' otherwise.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be YES if the given field can be obtained by drawing ticks of at least the given size and NO otherwise.\n\nYou may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answers).\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n8\n2 3 1\n*.*\n...\n4 9 2\n*.*.*...*\n.*.*...*.\n..*.*.*..\n.....*...\n4 4 1\n*.*.\n****\n.**.\n....\n5 5 1\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n5 5 2\n.....\n*...*\n.*.*.\n..*.*\n...*.\n4 7 1\n*.....*\n.....*.\n..*.*..\n...*...\n3 3 1\n***\n***\n***\n3 5 1\n*...*\n.***.\n.**..\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first sample test case consists of two asterisks neither of which can be independent ticks since ticks of size 0 don't exist.\n\nThe second sample test case is already described in the statement (check the picture in the statement). This field can be obtained by drawing ticks of sizes 2 and 3, as shown in the figure.\n\nThe field in the third sample test case corresponds to three ticks of size 1. Their center cells are marked with \\color{blue}{blue}, \\color{red}{red} and \\color{green}{green} colors: *.*.  \n---  \n*\\color{blue}{*}**  \n.\\color{green}{*}\\color{red}{*}.  \n....  \n  \nThe field in the fourth sample test case could have been obtained by drawing two ticks of sizes 1 and 2. Their vertices are marked below with \\color{blue}{blue} and \\color{red}{red} colors respectively: .....  \n---  \n*...*  \n.*.*.  \n..\\color{red}{*}.*  \n...\\color{blue}{*}.  \n  \nThe field in the fifth sample test case can not be obtained because k = 2, and the last asterisk in the fourth row from the top with coordinates (4, 5) can only be a part of a tick of size 1.\n\nThe field in the sixth sample test case can not be obtained because the top left asterisk (1, 1) can't be an independent tick, since the sizes of the ticks must be positive, and cannot be part of a tick with the center cell in the last row, since it is separated from it by a gap (a point, '.') in (2, 2).\n\nIn the seventh sample test case, similarly, the field can not be obtained by the described process because the asterisks with coordinates (1, 2) (second cell in the first row), (3, 1) and (3, 3) (leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom) can not be parts of any ticks."

You are to answer some questions about the tree.\n\nA tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a node v is the next vertex on the shortest path from v to the root.\n\nEach question is defined by three integers v, l, and k. To get the answer to the question, you need to perform the following steps: \n\n  * First, write down the sequence of all integers written on the shortest path from the vertex v to the root (including those written in the v and the root). \n  * Count the number of times each integer occurs. Remove all integers with less than l occurrences. \n  * Replace the sequence, removing all duplicates and ordering the elements by the number of occurrences in the original list in increasing order. In case of a tie, you can choose the order of these elements arbitrary. \n  * The answer to the question is the k-th number in the remaining sequence. Note that the answer is not always uniquely determined, because there could be several orderings. Also, it is possible that the length of the sequence on this step is less than k, in this case the answer is -1. \n\n\n\nFor example, if the sequence of integers on the path from v to the root is [2, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4], l = 2 and k = 2, then the answer is 1.\n\nPlease answer all questions about the tree.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.

As you take the eccentric little kid around, you notice something interesting about the structure of the city.\n\nLiyue can be represented as a directed graph containing n nodes. Nodes are labeled from 1 to n. There is a directed edge from node a to node b if and only if a < b.\n\nA path between nodes a and b is defined as a sequence of edges such that you can start at a, travel along all of these edges in the corresponding direction, and end at b. The length of a path is defined by the number of edges. A rainbow path of length x is defined as a path in the graph such that there exists at least 2 distinct colors among the set of x edges.\n\nTeucer's favorite number is k. You are curious about the following scenario: If you were to label each edge with a color, what is the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that all paths of length k or longer are rainbow paths?\n\nTeucer wants to surprise his older brother with a map of Liyue. He also wants to know a valid coloring of edges that uses the minimum number of colors. Please help him with this task!\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k < n ≤ 1000). \n\nOutput\n\nOn the first line, output c, the minimum colors you need to satisfy the above requirements.\n\nOn the second line, print a valid edge coloring as an array of (n(n-1))/(2) integers ranging from 1 to c. Exactly c distinct colors should exist in the construction. Print the edges in increasing order by the start node first, then by the second node.\n\nFor example, if n=4, the edge colors will correspond to this order of edges: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3 2 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n8 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1 2 2 \n\nNote\n\nThe corresponding construction for the first test case looks like this: \n\n<image> It is impossible to satisfy the constraints with less than 2 colors.\n\nThe corresponding construction for the second test case looks like this: \n\n<image> One can show there exists no construction using less than 3 colors."

    "prompt": "The new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1 … n] = [a_1, a_2, …, a_n].\n\nThis type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l … r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 … 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments.

Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

On each edge of the tree, there's a set of Christmas lights, which can be represented by an integer in binary representation.\n\n<image>\n\nHe has m elves come over and admire his tree. Each elf is assigned two nodes, a and b, and that elf looks at all lights on the simple path between the two nodes. After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\n\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of 1's when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even.\n\nHelp Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

If \n\n  * v = -1: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. \n  * v ≥ 0: The set of lights on the edge is v. \n\n\n\nThe next m lines of each test case each contains three integers, a, b, and p (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n; a ≠ b; 0 ≤ p ≤ 1) — the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n and the sum of all m don't exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 each.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not. \n\nIf the answer is YES, print n-1 lines each containing three integers: x, y, and v (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n; 0 ≤ v < 2^{30}) — the edge and the integer on that edge.

This is correct because: \n\n  * The first elf goes from node 2 to node 3. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the value 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The second elf goes from node 2 to node 5.

    "prompt": "Polycarp is very fond of playing the game Minesweeper. Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.\n\nThere are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known (x_i, y_i). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of k (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above.\n\nPolycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases in the test.\n\nAn empty line is written in front of each test suite.\n\nNext comes a line that contains integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.\n\nThen n lines follow, the i-th of which describes the x and y coordinates of the i-th mine and the time until its explosion (-10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ timer ≤ 10^9). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values n over all test cases in the test does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data — the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n\n5 0\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n5 2\n0 0 1\n0 1 4\n1 0 2\n1 1 3\n2 2 9\n\n6 1\n1 -1 3\n0 -1 9\n0 1 7\n-1 0 1\n-1 1 9\n-1 -1 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1\n0\n\nNote\n\n<image> Picture from examples\n\nFirst example: \n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2), it does not detonate any other mine since k=0. \n  * 1 second: we explode the mine at the cell (0, 1), and the mine at the cell (0, 0) explodes itself. \n  * 2 second: we explode the mine at the cell (1, 1), and the mine at the cell (1, 0) explodes itself.\n\n\n\nSecond example:\n\n  * 0 second: we explode a mine at the cell (2, 2) we get: \n\n<image>\n\n  * 1 second: the mine at coordinate (0, 0) explodes and since k=2 the explosion detonates mines at the cells (0, 1) and (1, 0), and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell (1, 1) and there are no mines left on the field.

However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon. \n\nNote: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored.\n\nAfter the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let w be the number of white nodes, r be the number of red nodes, and b be the number of blue nodes.

    "prompt": "A binary tree of n nodes is given. Nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to n and the root is the node 1. Each node can have no child, only one left child, only one right child, or both children. For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes?\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a ≠ b; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Note that the given string c is not the initial string representation of the tree.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 ≤ l_i, r_i ≤ n). If the node i does not have the left child, l_i = 0, and if the node i does not have the right child, r_i = 0.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given input forms a binary tree, rooted at 1.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single line, containing the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree if at most k nodes have their labels duplicated.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n4 3\nabab\n2 3\n0 0\n0 4\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nbaaaab\n\nInput\n\n\n8 2\nkadracyn\n2 5\n3 4\n0 0\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndaarkkcyan\n\nInput\n\n\n8 3\nkdaracyn\n2 5\n0 3\n0 4\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndarkcyan\n\nNote\n\nThe images below present the tree for the examples. The number in each node is the node number, while the subscripted letter is its label. To the right is the string representation of the tree, with each letter having the same color as the corresponding node.\n\nHere is the tree for the first example. Here we duplicated the labels of nodes 1 and 3. We should not duplicate the label of node 2 because it would give us the string \"bbaaab\", which is lexicographically greater than \"baaaab\".\n\n<image>\n\nIn the second example, we can duplicate the labels of nodes 1 and 2. Note that only duplicating the label of the root will produce a worse result than the initial string.\n\n<image>\n\nIn the third example, we should not duplicate any character at all. Even though we would want to duplicate the label of the node 3, by duplicating it we must also duplicate the label of the node 2, which produces a worse result.\n\n<image>\n\nThere is no way to produce string \"darkkcyan\" from a tree with the initial string representation \"darkcyan\" :(."

    "prompt": "The grasshopper is located on the numeric axis at the point with coordinate x_0.\n\nHaving nothing else to do he starts jumping between integer points on the axis. Making a jump from a point with coordinate x with a distance d to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate x - d, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate x + d.\n\nThe grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer i starting with 1 the following holds: exactly i minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly i. So, in the first minutes he jumps by 1, then by 2, and so on.\n\nThe direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the left, otherwise he jumps to the right.\n\nFor example, if after 18 consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate 7, he will jump by a distance of 19 to the right, since 7 is an odd number, and will end up at a point 7 + 19 = 26. Since 26 is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of 20, and it will move him to the point 26 - 20 = 6.\n\nFind exactly which point the grasshopper will be at after exactly n jumps.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.\n\nEach of the following t lines contains two integers x_0 (-10^{14} ≤ x_0 ≤ 10^{14}) and n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^{14}) — the coordinate of the grasshopper's initial position and the number of jumps.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint exactly t lines.

    "prompt": "Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. In this game, his character has to kill a dragon. The battle with the dragon lasts 100^{500} seconds, during which Monocarp attacks the dragon with a poisoned dagger. The i-th attack is performed at the beginning of the a_i-th second from the battle start. The dagger itself does not deal damage, but it applies a poison effect on the dragon, which deals 1 damage during each of the next k seconds (starting with the same second when the dragon was stabbed by the dagger). However, if the dragon has already been poisoned, then the dagger updates the poison effect (i.e. cancels the current poison effect and applies a new one).\n\nFor example, suppose k = 4, and Monocarp stabs the dragon during the seconds 2, 4 and 10.

Therefore, it will take |5 - 8| + |12 - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13 units of time to type the word \"hello\". \n\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard — a string of length 26, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters from 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard.\n\nThe second line of the description contains the word s. The word has a length from 1 to 50 letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the word s on the given keyboard.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ni\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\ncodeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nabacaba\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n13\n0\n68\n0\n74"

They want to play the Hat k times. Thus, k games will be played at each table. Each player will play in k games.\n\nTo do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game. During each game, one player plays at exactly one table. A player can play at different tables.\n\nPlayers want to have the most \"fair\" schedule of games. For this reason, they are looking for a schedule (table distribution for each game) such that:\n\n  * At any table in each game there are either ⌊n/m⌋ people or ⌈n/m⌉ people (that is, either n/m rounded down, or n/m rounded up). Different numbers of people can play different games at the same table.\n  * Let's calculate for each player the value b_i — the number of times the i-th player played at a table with ⌈n/m⌉ persons (n/m rounded up).

    "prompt": "The statement of this problem shares a lot with problem A. The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not ≡ 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x ⋅ y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 ≤ a < 10^9 + 7 and a ⋅ y ≡ x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, c_d, and p (4 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^5, n, m ≥ 2, 1 ≤ r_b, r_d ≤ n, 1 ≤ c_b, c_d ≤ m, 1 ≤ p ≤ 99) — the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot, the position of the dirt cell and the probability of cleaning in percentage.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2 2 1 1 2 1 25\n3 3 1 2 2 2 25\n10 10 1 1 10 10 75\n10 10 10 10 1 1 75\n5 5 1 3 2 2 10\n97 98 3 5 41 43 50\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3\n15\n15\n332103349\n99224487\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the robot has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second. Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped. But the movements in both cases are identical, hence the same result."

    "prompt": "You are given an array a[0 … n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, …, a_{n - 1}] of zeroes and ones only. Note that in this problem, unlike the others, the array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one.\n\nIn one step, the array a is replaced by another array of length n according to the following rules: \n\n  1. First, a new array a^{→ d} is defined as a cyclic shift of the array a to the right by d cells. The elements of this array can be defined as a^{→ d}_i = a_{(i + n - d) mod n}, where (i + n - d) mod n is the remainder of integer division of i + n - d by n. \n\nIt means that the whole array a^{→ d} can be represented as a sequence $$$a^{→ d} = [a_{n - d}, a_{n - d + 1}, …, a_{n - 1}, a_0, a_1, …, a_{n - d - 1}]$$$\n\n  2. Then each element of the array a_i is replaced by a_i  \\&  a^{→ d}_i, where \\& is a logical \"AND\" operator. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [0, 0, 1, 1] and d = 1, then a^{→ d} = [1, 0, 0, 1] and the value of a after the first step will be [0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 1  \\&  0, 1  \\&  1], that is [0, 0, 0, 1].\n\nThe process ends when the array stops changing. For a given array a, determine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If yes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe next 2t lines contain descriptions of the test cases. \n\nThe first line of each test case description contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — array size and d (1 ≤ d ≤ n) — cyclic shift offset. The second line of the description contains n space-separated integers a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) — elements of the array.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should be a single integer — the number of steps after which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are still elements equal to 1 in the array after the end of the process, print -1.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n5\n2 1\n0 1\n3 2\n0 1 0\n5 2\n1 1 0 1 0\n4 2\n0 1 0 1\n1 1\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n-1\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the third sample test case the array will change as follows: \n\n  1. At the beginning a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], and a^{→ 2} = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to $$$[1  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]$$$ \n  2. Now a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0], then a^{→ 2} = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n  3. And finally, when a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] we get a^{→ 2} = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]. Their element-by-element \"AND\" equals to $$$[1  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  1, 0  \\&  0, 0  \\&  0] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$ \n\nThus, the answer is 3 steps.\n\nIn the fourth sample test case, the array will not change as it shifts by 2 to the right, so each element will be calculated as 0  \\&  0 or 1  \\&  1 thus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain only zeros."

    "prompt": "This is an interactive problem!\n\nAs part of your contribution in the Great Bubble War, you have been tasked with finding the newly built enemy fortress. The world you live in is a giant 10^9 × 10^9 grid, with squares having both coordinates between 1 and 10^9. \n\nYou know that the enemy base has the shape of a rectangle, with the sides parallel to the sides of the grid. The people of your world are extremely scared of being at the edge of the world, so you know that the base doesn't contain any of the squares on the edges of the grid (the x or y coordinate being 1 or 10^9). \n\nTo help you locate the base, you have been given a device that you can place in any square of the grid, and it will tell you the manhattan distance to the closest square of the base. The manhattan distance from square (a, b) to square (p, q) is calculated as |a−p|+|b−q|. If you try to place the device inside the enemy base, you will be captured by the enemy. Because of this, you need to make sure to never place the device inside the enemy base. \n\nUnfortunately, the device is powered by a battery and you can't recharge it. This means that you can use the device at most 40 times. \n\nInput\n\nThe input contains the answers to your queries. \n\nInteraction\n\nYour code is allowed to place the device on any square in the grid by writing \"? i j\" (1 ≤ i,j ≤ 10^9). In return, it will recieve the manhattan distance to the closest square of the enemy base from square (i,j) or -1 if the square you placed the device on is inside the enemy base or outside the grid. \n\nIf you recieve -1 instead of a positive number, exit immidiately and you will see the wrong answer verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\nYour solution should use no more than 40 queries. \n\nOnce you are sure where the enemy base is located, you should print \"! x y p q\" (1 ≤ x ≤ p≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ y ≤ q≤ 10^9), where (x, y) is the square inside the enemy base with the smallest x and y coordinates, and (p, q) is the square inside the enemy base with the largest x and y coordinates. Note that answering doesn't count as one of the 40 queries.\n\nAfter printing a query or printing the answer, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: \n\n  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; \n  * System.out.flush() in Java; \n  * flush(output) in Pascal; \n  * stdout.flush() in Python; \n  * See the documentation for other languages.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n? 2 2\n? 5 5\n? 4 7\n? 1 5\n! 2 3 4 5"

Today, you're working with a long strip, with height 1 and length n, some positions of which are occupied by 1 by 1 Lego pieces.\n\nIn one second, you can either remove two adjacent Lego pieces from the strip (if both are present), or add two Lego pieces to adjacent positions (if both are absent). You can only add or remove Lego's at two adjacent positions at the same time, as otherwise your chubby fingers run into precision issues.\n\nYou want to know exactly how much time you'll spend playing with Legos. You value efficiency, so given some starting state and some ending state, you'll always spend the least number of seconds to transform the starting state into the ending state. If it's impossible to transform the starting state into the ending state, you just skip it (so you spend 0 seconds).\n\nThe issue is that, for some positions, you don't remember whether there were Legos there or not (in either the starting state, the ending state, or both). Over all pairs of (starting state, ending state) that are consistent with your memory, find the total amount of time it will take to transform the starting state to the ending state.

That's why for his birthday, his friends bought him a really interesting machine – an array beautifier. \n\nThe array beautifier takes an array A consisting of N integers, and it outputs a new array B of length N that it constructed based on the array given to it. The array beautifier constructs the new array in the following way: it takes two numbers at different indices from the original array and writes their sum to the end of the new array. It does this step N times - resulting in an output array of length N. During this process, the machine can take the same index multiple times in different steps. \n\nBob was very excited about the gift that his friends gave him, so he put his favorite array in the machine. However, when the machine finished, Bob was not happy with the resulting array. He misses his favorite array very much, and hopes to get it back. \n\nGiven the array that the machine outputted, help Bob find an array that could be the original array that he put in the machine. Sometimes the machine makes mistakes, so it is possible that no appropriate input array exists for the array it has outputted. In such case, let Bob know that his array is forever lost.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one positive integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10^3) – the length of Bob's array.\n\nThe second line contains N integers B_1, B_2, ..., B_N (1 ≤ B_i ≤ 10^6) – the elements of the array the machine outputted.\n\nOutput\n\nIf an appropriate input array exists, print \"YES\", followed by the input array A_1, A_2, ..., A_N (-10^9 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9) in the next line.
