He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\n\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\ge 1$ — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$. In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ $(i < j)$ such that $b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}$.

At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease.

One team goes first, and the other goes second. Each match will result in exactly one team winning.

To read books 3,5,6, you do not have to read any other books.\nFor example, if you read books 5,3,4,2 in this order, you can read book 1. This is a correct answer, because you will never be able to read book 1 with three or fewer books read. As another example, reading books 3,5,4,2 in this order also allows you to read book 1 with 4 books read.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n6\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n1 5\r\n1 6\r\n0\n\nSample Output 2\n\n6 5 4 3 2\n\nSample Input 3\n\n8\r\n1 5\r\n1 6\r\n1 7\r\n1 8\r\n0\r\n0\r\n0\r\n0\n\nSample Output 3\n\n5"

As a result, Aoki received a string T' consisting of lowercase English letters.\nT' may have been altered from T. Specifically, exactly one of the following four conditions is known to hold.\n\n- T' is equal to T.\n- T' is a string obtained by inserting one lowercase English letter at one position (possibly the beginning and end) in T.\n- T' is a string obtained by deleting one character from T.\n- T' is a string obtained by changing one character in T to another lowercase English letter.\n\nYou are given the string T' received by Aoki and N strings S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N consisting of lowercase English letters. Find all the strings among S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N that could equal the string T sent by Takahashi.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN T'\r\nS_1\r\nS_2\r\n\\vdots\r\nS_N\n\nOutput\n\nLet (i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_K) be the sequence of indices of all the strings among S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N that could be equal to T, in ascending order.\r\nPrint the length K of this sequence, and the sequence itself, in the following format:\nK\r\ni_1 i_2 \\ldots i_K\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- N is an integer.\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 5 \\times 10^5\n- S_i and T' are strings of length between 1 and 5 \\times 10^5, inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n- The total length of S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N is at most 5 \\times 10^5.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5 ababc\r\nababc\r\nbabc\r\nabacbc\r\nabdbc\r\nabbac\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\r\n1 2 3 4\r\n\nAmong S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_5, the strings that could be equal to T are S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, as explained below.\n\n- S_1 could be equal to T, because T' =  ababc is equal to S_1 =  ababc.\n- S_2 could be equal to T, because T' =  ababc is obtained by inserting the letter a at the beginning of S_2 =  babc.\n- S_3 could be equal to T, because T' =  ababc is obtained by deleting the fourth character c from S_3 =  abacbc.\n- S_4 could be equal to T, because T' =  ababc is obtained by changing the third character d in S_4 =  abdbc to b.\n- S_5 could not be equal to T, because if we take S_5 =  abbac as T, then T' =  ababc does not satisfy any of the four conditions in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n1 aoki\r\ntakahashi\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0\n\nSample Input 3\n\n9 atcoder\r\natoder\r\natcode\r\nathqcoder\r\natcoder\r\ntacoder\r\njttcoder\r\natoder\r\natceoder\r\natcoer\n\nSample Output 3\n\n6\r\n1 2 4 7 8 9"

Specifically, for i=1,2,\\dots,T, the score of player A_i will increase by B_i points at i seconds from now. There will be no other change in the scores.\nTakahashi, who prefers diversity in scores, wants to know how many different score values will appear among the players' scores at each moment. For each i=1,2,\\dots,T, find the number of different score values among the players' scores at i+0.5 seconds from now.\nFor example, if the players have 10, 20, 30, and 20 points at some moment, there are three different score values among the players' scores at that moment.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN T\nA_1 B_1\nA_2 B_2\n\\vdots\nA_T B_T\n\nOutput\n\nPrint T lines.\nThe i-th line (1\\leq i \\leq T) should contain an integer representing the number of different score values among the players' scores at i+0.5 seconds from now.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1\\leq N, T\\leq 2\\times 10^5\n- 1\\leq A_i \\leq N\n- 1\\leq B_i \\leq 10^9\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 4\n1 10\n3 20\n2 10\n2 10\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n3\n2\n2\n\nLet S be the sequence of scores of players 1, 2, 3 in this order.\nCurrently, S=\\lbrace 0,0,0\\rbrace.\n\n- After one second, the score of player 1 increases by 10 points, making S=\\lbrace 10,0,0\\rbrace. Thus, there are two different score values among the players' scores at 1.5 seconds from now.\n- After two seconds, the score of player 3 increases by 20 points, making S=\\lbrace 10,0,20\\rbrace. Thus, there are three different score values among the players' scores at 2.5 seconds from now.\n- After three seconds, the score of player 2 increases by 10 points, making S=\\lbrace 10,10,20\\rbrace. Therefore, there are two different score values among the players' scores at 3.5 seconds from now.\n- After four seconds, the score of player 2 increases by 10 points, making S=\\lbrace 10,20,20\\rbrace. Therefore, there are two different score values among the players' scores at 4.5 seconds from now.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n1 3\n1 3\n1 4\n1 3\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1\n1\n1\n\nSample Input 3\n\n10 10\n7 2620\n9 2620\n8 3375\n1 3375\n6 1395\n5 1395\n6 2923\n10 3375\n9 5929\n5 1225\n\nSample Output 3\n\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\n4\n5\n5\n6\n5"
