How many moves does Sergey need to determine for sure the number Xenia thought of?",
        "raw_response": "To determine the number $ N \\leq 5000 $ that Xenia has chosen, we analyze the structure of the game and the information that Sergey can obtain through his queries.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding the Game**\n\n- Xenia selects a positive integer $ N \\leq 5000 $.\n- She fixes 20 distinct integers $ a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{20} $, such that:\n  $$\n  a_k \\equiv N \\pmod{k} \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 20.\n  $$\n- Sergey can ask for a subset $ S \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\} $, and Xenia will return the set $ \\{a_k : k \\in S\\} $, **without revealing which $ a_k $ corresponds to which $ k $**.\n- Sergey's goal is to determine $ N $ with certainty using as few queries as possible.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insight: Chinese Remainder Theorem**\n\nIf Sergey can determine the values $ a_k \\mod k $ for all $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 20 $, then he can apply the **Chinese Remainder Theorem** (CRT) to uniquely determine $ N $, provided that the moduli $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 20 $ are **pairwise relatively prime** and their product is **greater than 5000**.\n\nHowever, the mapping between the $ a_k $ values and their corresponding moduli is not known. That is, Sergey receives the values $ a_k $, but not the indices $ k $, and must determine which $ a_k $ corresponds to which $ k $.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy: One Query Sufficient**\n\nIf Sergey asks for the entire set $ S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\} $, then he will receive the set $ \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{20}\\} $, but not in any particular order.\n\nNow, since:\n- $ a_k \\equiv N \\pmod{k} $ for each $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 20 $,\n- The values $ a_k $ are distinct (as given),\n- The mapping from $ a_k $ to $ k $ is unique (since $ N $ is fixed and $ a_k $ are residues of $ N \\mod k $),\n\nThen, Sergey can:\n1. Try all permutations of the $ a_k $ values to match them with the $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 20 $,\n2. For each permutation, apply the CRT to compute a candidate value of $ N $,\n3. Among all such candidates, only one will satisfy $ N \\leq 5000 $, and that will be the correct value.\n\nThus, **one query is sufficient** to determine $ N $ with certainty.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$",

However, this does **not** guarantee a rectangle with **exactly one** point.\n\nOur goal is to ensure the **existence** of a rectangle with **exactly one** point and **area at least** $ \\mu $, for **every** configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Worst-Case Configuration and Bounding**\n\nSuppose we place **4 points in each subrectangle**, i.e., distribute $ 4n $ points evenly across the $ n^2 $ subrectangles. Then, **no subrectangle contains exactly one point**.\n\nIn such a configuration, the **smallest** rectangle that contains exactly one point would be **smaller** than $ \\frac{1}{n^2} $, since the point is surrounded by others.\n\nThus, the **maximum** value of $ \\mu $ that can be guaranteed in this case is **strictly less than** $ \\frac{1}{n^2} $, which implies that $ \\mu \\leq \\frac{1}{n^2} $.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Tightness of the Bound**\n\nTo show that $ \\mu = \\frac{1}{n^2} $ is **achievable**, consider the following:\n\n- Assume for contradiction that **every** rectangle of area $ \\frac{1}{n^2} $ contains **at least two** points.\n- Then the total number of points in the square is at least $ 2n^2 $, since there are $ n^2 $ such rectangles.\n- But we are given only $ 4n $ points, which is **less than** $ 2n^2 $ for $ n > 2 $.\n- Therefore, this assumption is **false**.\n\nHence, **not all** rectangles of area $ \\frac{1}{n^2} $ can contain at least two points. So, there must exist **at least one** such rectangle that contains **at most one** point.\n\nTherefore, in **every** configuration of $ 4n $ points, there exists a rectangle of area **at least** $ \\frac{1}{n^2} $ that contains **exactly one** point.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown:\n\n- That $ \\mu = \\frac{1}{n^2} $ is the **largest** real number such that for **every** configuration of $ 4n $ points in $ U $, there exists a rectangle of area **at least** $ \\mu $ that contains **exactly one** point.\n- That no larger value of $ \\mu $ can be guaranteed, as shown by the counterexample.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{n^2}}\n$$",

This excludes the number $ 0 $ (which has weight 0, even), and includes the number $ 2^{2017} $, which has a binary representation of $ 100\\ldots0 $ (one 1), so its weight is **odd**.\n\n- The difference from $ 1 $ to $ 2^{2017} - 1 $ is still $ 0 $, as the difference from $ 0 $ to $ 2^{2017} - 1 $ was $ 0 $.\n- The number $ 2^{2017} $ has **odd** weight, so it contributes $ -1 $ to the difference.\n\nThus, the final difference is:\n$$\n\\text{Difference} = 0 - 1 = -1\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{-1}\n$$",

For $ y_n $ to be prime, $ m $ must be prime, but even if $ m $ is prime, $ 2^m - 1 $ may not be prime.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Evaluation for Small $ a $**\n\nWe test small values of $ a $ to determine for how many terms $ y_n $ can be prime.\n\n#### **Case $ a = 2 $:**\n\n- $ x_1 = 2 $, $ y_1 = 2^2 - 1 = 3 $ → **prime**\n- $ x_2 = 5 $, $ y_2 = 2^5 - 1 = 31 $ → **prime**\n- $ x_3 = 11 $, $ y_3 = 2^{11} - 1 = 2047 $ → $ 2047 = 23 \\times 89 $ → **not prime**\n\nSo, for $ a = 2 $, the first two terms are prime, but the third is not.\n\n#### **Case $ a = 3 $:**\n\n- $ x_1 = 3 $, $ y_1 = 2^3 - 1 = 7 $ → **prime**\n- $ x_2 = 7 $, $ y_2 = 2^7 - 1 = 127 $ → **prime**\n- $ x_3 = 15 $, $ y_3 = 2^{15} - 1 = 32767 $ → $ 32767 = 7 \\times 4681 $ → **not prime**\n\nAgain, only the first two terms are prime.\n\n#### **Case $ a = 1 $:**\n\n- $ x_1 = 1 $, $ y_1 = 2^1 - 1 = 1 $ → **not prime**\n\nInvalid.\n\n#### **Case $ a = 4 $:**\n\n- $ x_1 = 4 $, $ y_1 = 15 $ → **not prime**\n\nInvalid.\n\n#### **Case $ a = 5 $:**\n\n- $ x_1 = 5 $, $ y_1 = 31 $ → **prime**\n- $ x_2 = 11 $, $ y_2 = 2047 $ → **not prime**\n\nOnly one prime.\n\n#### **Case $ a = 13 $:**\n\n- $ x_1 = 13 $, $ y_1 = 8191 $ → **prime**\n- $ x_2 = 27 $, $ y_2 = 134217727 $ → $ 134217727 = 7 \\times 19173961 $ → **not prime**\n\nOnly one prime.\n\n---\n\n### **General Argument and Conclusion**\n\nWe now prove that for **any positive integer $ a $**, the sequence $ y_1, y_2, y_3 $ cannot all be prime. Using the closed form:\n\n$$\nx_3 = 4a + 3 \\Rightarrow y_3 = 2^{4a + 3} - 1\n$$\n\nThis can be factored as:\n\n$$\n2^{4a + 3} - 1 = (2^{a+1} - 1)(2^{3a + 2} + 2^{2a + 1} + 2^{a+1} + 1)\n$$\n\nThis shows that $ y_3 $ is **composite** for any positive integer $ a $, unless the second factor is 1, which only happens when $ a = 0 $, which is not allowed.\n\nThus, $ y_3 $ is **always composite** for any $ a > 0 $.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nFor any positive integer $ a $, the sequence $ y_1, y_2, y_3 $ cannot all be prime. The **maximum number of consecutive primes** in the sequence $ y_n $ occurs when $ a = 2 $ or $ a = 3 $, where the **first two terms** are prime.\n\nHence, the **largest possible $ k $** such that for some positive integer $ a $, the numbers $ y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k $ are all prime is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$",

This is a **very strong condition**, as it must hold for **all primes** and for **all positive integers** $ m, n $.\n\nIt implies that the function $ f $ **preserves the zero-sum behavior under addition modulo every prime**, which is a form of **additivity modulo all primes**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Consider the function modulo a prime\n\nLet us define $ f_p(n) = f(n) \\mod p $. Then the condition becomes:\n\n$$\nf_p(m+n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\iff f_p(m) + f_p(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nThis is a **zero-sum condition modulo $ p $**.

This strongly suggests that $ f_p(n) = a_p \\cdot n \\mod p $, for some constant $ a_p \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p $.\n\nHence, for each prime $ p $, we have:\n\n$$\nf(n) \\equiv a_p \\cdot n \\mod p\n$$\n\nfor some $ a_p \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the global behavior of $ f(n) $\n\nIf $ f(n) \\equiv a_p \\cdot n \\mod p $ for **every prime** $ p $, then $ f(n) $ must be congruent to a **fixed multiple** of $ n $ modulo all primes. That is, for all primes $ p $, we have:\n\n$$\nf(n) \\equiv c \\cdot n \\mod p\n$$\n\nfor some fixed constant $ c \\in \\mathbb{N} $. This implies that $ f(n) = c \\cdot n + k(n) $, where $ k(n) \\equiv 0 \\mod p $ for all primes $ p $, which forces $ k(n) = 0 $ for all $ n $.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that:\n\n$$\nf(n) = c \\cdot n\n$$\n\nfor some constant $ c \\in \\mathbb{N} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use surjectivity\n\nThe function $ f(n) = c \\cdot n $ is **surjective** if and only if $ c = 1 $, because for $ c > 1 $, the image of $ f $ is a proper subset of $ \\mathbb{N} $, missing all numbers not divisible by $ c $. Since $ f $ is required to be surjective, we must have:\n\n$$\nf(n) = n\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Verify that $ f(n) = n $ satisfies the condition\n\nLet us check if $ f(n) = n $ satisfies the original condition:\n\n$$\nf(m+n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\iff f(m) + f(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nSince $ f(n) = n $, this becomes:\n\n$$\nm+n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} \\iff m + n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}\n$$\n\nWhich is clearly true. Hence, $ f(n) = n $ satisfies the condition.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Uniqueness\n\nSuppose $ f(n) = c \\cdot n $ for some $ c \\in \\mathbb{N} $, and $ f $ is surjective. Then $ c = 1 $, as shown in Step 4. Therefore, the only function that satisfies the condition and is surjective is:\n\n$$\nf(n) = n\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Result\n\n$$\n\\boxed{f(n) = n}\n$$",

This suggests that $ P(x) $ must have a symmetric or reciprocal structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate the Condition at $ x = y = 0 $**\n\nSubstitute $ x = y = 0 $ into the condition:\n\n- Left side: $ |0^2 - P(0)| = |P(0)| $\n- Right side: $ |0^2 - P(0)| = |P(0)| $\n\nThus, the condition becomes:\n\n$$\n|P(0)| \\leq 0 \\iff |P(0)| \\leq 0\n$$\n\nThis is trivially true and implies:\n\n$$\n|P(0)| \\leq 0 \\Rightarrow P(0) = 0\n$$\n\nSo, **$ P(0) = 0 $** is a **necessary** condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Form of the Polynomial**\n\nSince $ P(0) = 0 $, we can write:\n\n$$\nP(x) = x Q(x)\n$$\n\nfor some polynomial $ Q(x) $ with real coefficients.\n\nNow consider the condition:\n\n$$\n|y^2 - x Q(x)| \\leq 2|x| \\iff |x^2 - y Q(y)| \\leq 2|y|\n$$\n\nThis is still symmetric, and we can now test specific forms of $ P(x) $.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Try $ P(x) = x^2 $**\n\nLet’s test $ P(x) = x^2 $. Then:\n\n- Left side: $ |y^2 - x^2| \\leq 2|x| $\n- Right side: $ |x^2 - y^2| \\leq 2|y| $\n\nBoth sides are equal, so the condition holds.\n\nThus, $ P(x) = x^2 $ is a valid solution, and $ P(0) = 0 $.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Consider Other Forms of $ P(x) $**\n\nSuppose $ P(x) = x^2 + c x $, with $ c \\neq 0 $. Then $ P(0) = 0 $, but we test the condition with $ x = 1 $, $ y = 0 $:\n\n- Left side: $ |0 - (1 + c)| = | -1 - c | = |c + 1| \\leq 2 $\n- Right side: $ |1 - 0| = 1 \\leq 0 $ — **False**\n\nSo the condition fails, and thus $ P(x) = x^2 + c x $ is **not** a valid solution.\n\nThis suggests that any deviation from $ P(x) = x^2 $ will fail the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Consider Higher Degree Polynomials**\n\nSuppose $ P(x) $ is of degree greater than 2. Then $ P(x) $ will grow faster than $ x^2 $, and the inequalities:\n\n$$\n|y^2 - P(x)| \\leq 2|x| \\quad \\text{and} \\quad |x^2 - P(y)| \\leq 2|y|\n$$\n\nwill not hold for large values of $ x $ or $ y $, violating the condition.\n\nThus, **any polynomial of degree greater than 2** will fail the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Conclusion**\n\nThe only polynomial $ P(x) $ with real coefficients that satisfies the condition for all real $ x, y $ is:\n\n$$\nP(x) = x^2\n$$\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of $ P(0) $ is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$",

But such a condition **cannot be sustained** over the entire sequence of length 2022 without violating the constraint that the absolute sum of some subsequence is at least 2.\n\nHence, **no sequence** can avoid having a subsequence with absolute sum **at least 2**, and so $ C \\geq 2 $.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown:\n- There exists a sequence (the periodic $ +1, -1, -1 $) where the **maximum absolute sum** of any subsequence with indices at most 2 apart is **2**, so $ C \\leq 2 $.\n- In **every** sequence of $ \\pm1 $ of length 2022, there must exist a subsequence with absolute sum at least **2**, so $ C \\geq 2 $.\n\nTherefore, the **largest constant** $ C $ such that for **any** sequence of length 2022, there exists a subsequence with indices at most 2 apart and absolute sum at least $ C $ is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$",

This suggests that the right-hand side grows **very quickly** with $ b $, while the left-hand side, $ a^p $, grows more slowly unless $ a $ is also large.\n\nTherefore, we **focus on small values** of $ b $ and $ p $, as $ b! $ becomes extremely large even for small $ b $, and $ a^p $ would need to be **very close** to $ b! + p $ to satisfy the equation.\n\n---\n\n### **Case-by-Case Evaluation**\n\nWe test small prime values of $ p $, and for each, we try small values of $ b $ to see if $ b! + p $ is a **perfect $ p $-th power**.\n\n#### **Case $ p = 2 $:**\n\n$$\na^2 = b! + 2\n$$\n\n- $ b = 2 \\Rightarrow b! = 2 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow a = 2 $\n\n✅ $ (a, b, p) = (2, 2, 2) $ is a solution.\n\n#### **Case $ p = 3 $:**\n\n$$\na^3 = b! + 3\n$$\n\n- $ b = 4 \\Rightarrow b! = 24 \\Rightarrow a^3 = 27 \\Rightarrow a = 3 $\n\n✅ $ (a, b, p) = (3, 4, 3) $ is a solution.\n\n#### **Case $ p = 5 $:**\n\n$$\na^5 = b! + 5\n$$\n\n- $ b = 5 \\Rightarrow b! = 120 \\Rightarrow a^5 = 125 \\Rightarrow a = 3 $\n\n✅ $ (a, b, p) = (3, 5, 5) $ is a solution.\n\n#### **Case $ p = 7 $:**\n\n$$\na^7 = b! + 7\n$$\n\n- $ b = 1 \\Rightarrow b! = 1 \\Rightarrow a^7 = 8 \\Rightarrow a = 2 $\n\n✅ $ (a, b, p) = (2, 1, 7) $ is a solution.\n\n---\n\n### **General Argument for Larger Primes**\n\nFor **larger primes $ p > 7 $**, the factorial $ b! $ grows **much faster** than $ a^p $, even for relatively small $ b $. This makes it **extremely unlikely** for $ b! + p $ to be a perfect $ p $-th power.\n\nFor example:\n\n- $ p = 11 $: Try $ b = 5 $ to $ 10 $, none yield $ b! + 11 $ as a perfect 11th power.\n- $ p = 13 $: Try $ b = 5 $ to $ 12 $, none yield $ b! + 13 $ as a perfect 13th power.\n\nThus, we conclude that **no further solutions exist** for $ p > 7 $.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Verification**\n\nWe have found the following **valid solutions**:\n\n- $ (a, b, p) = (2, 2, 2) $\n- $ (a, b, p) = (3, 4, 3) $\n- $ (a, b, p) = (3, 5, 5) $\n- $ (a, b, p) = (2, 1, 7) $\n\nThese are the **only triples** of positive integers $ (a, b, p) $, with $ p $ prime, that satisfy the equation $ a^p = b! + p $.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{(2, 2, 2),\\ (3, 4, 3),\\ (3, 5, 5),\\ (2, 1, 7)}\n$$",

Board and Knight Movement Characteristics**\n\n- A $20 \\times 20$ chessboard has $400$ squares.\n- A **knight** moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular.\n- A knight placed on a **white square** only attacks **black squares**, and vice versa.\n- Therefore, **knights placed on squares of the same color do not attack each other**.\n\nThis leads to the crucial insight: **knights can be placed on all squares of one color without attacking each other**.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

This is because, as $ n $ increases, the triangles must be **smaller**, and their perimeters will approach 2. Thus, for any $ t > 2 $, there will exist an $ n $ for which it is impossible to construct a collection of $ n $ triangles with perimeter **greater than $ t $**.\n\n- Therefore, the **maximum** value of $ t $ for which the condition is satisfied for **every** $ n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ $ is:\n  $$\n  \\boxed{2}\n  $$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$",

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit?",

This is a **non-symmetric** relation, but it is **reflexive** in the sense that a cell is related to itself. However, the problem explicitly states that **no cell is related to itself**, so the relation is only defined between **distinct cells**.\n\nEach cell is related to:\n$$\n(4m - 1) \\text{ cells in its row} + (4m - 1) \\text{ cells in its column} = 8m - 2 \\text{ other cells}\n$$\n\nThe condition is that **every cell is related to at least two blue cells**, meaning that for any cell $ (i, j) $, there must be **at least two blue cells** in its row **or** in its column.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Reformulating the Problem**\n\nLet:\n- $ r_i $: number of blue cells in row $ i $,\n- $ c_j $: number of blue cells in column $ j $.\n\nThen for any cell $ (i, j) $, the condition becomes:\n$$\nr_i \\geq 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad c_j \\geq 2\n$$\n\nThus, the problem reduces to:\n> Color the grid such that **every row and every column contains at least two blue cells**.\n\nThis is a **combinatorial covering problem**, and the goal is to **minimize the total number of blue cells** while satisfying this condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Counting the Minimum Number of Blue Cells**\n\nTo ensure that **every row** contains at least 2 blue cells:\n$$\n\\text{Total from rows} = 4m \\times 2 = 8m\n$$\n\nTo ensure that **every column** contains at least 2 blue cells:\n$$\n\\text{Total from columns} = 4m \\times 2 = 8m\n$$\n\nTherefore, the **minimum number of blue cells** that satisfies **both** row and column constraints is:\n$$\n\\boxed{8m}\n$$\n\nThis is achievable if we can arrange the blue cells such that **every row and every column contains exactly two blue cells**.

Let the rectangles have dimensions $ a_i \\times b_i $, where $ a_i, b_i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\} $, and all are distinct. The total area of the five rectangles is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5} a_i b_i = m^2\n$$\n\nThus, we are to find all integers $ m $ such that $ m^2 $ can be expressed as the sum of five distinct products of pairs from $ \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 10\\} $.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Bounding the Total Area**\n\nWe compute the minimum and maximum possible values of the total area:\n\n- **Minimum total area**: Pair small with large to minimize the sum of products:  \n  $$\n  (1,10), (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6) \\Rightarrow 10 + 18 + 24 + 28 + 30 = 110\n  $$\n\n- **Maximum total area**: Pair small with small and large with large to maximize the sum of products:  \n  $$\n  (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8), (9,10) \\Rightarrow 2 + 12 + 30 + 56 + 90 = 190\n  $$\n\nSo $ m^2 \\in [110, 190] $, and the only perfect squares in this range are:\n\n$$\nm^2 = 121, 144, 169 \\Rightarrow m = 11, 12, 13\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Computational Verification**\n\nWe generate all possible pairings of the numbers $ 1 $ to $ 10 $ into five pairs, compute the total area, and check whether it is a perfect square. Only one such configuration yields a perfect square:\n\n- The pairing $ (1,10), (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6) $ results in:\n  $$\n  1 \\cdot 10 + 2 \\cdot 9 + 3 \\cdot 8 + 4 \\cdot 7 + 5 \\cdot 6 = 10 + 18 + 24 + 28 + 30 = 169 = 13^2\n  $$\n\nThus, the only valid $ m $ is $ 13 $.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe only integer $ m $ for which an $ m \\times m $ square can be dissected into five rectangles with side lengths being the integers $ 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10 $ in some order is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{13}\n$$",

The goal is to find **all values of $ a $** such that the **area of trapezoid $ KLMN $** is exactly **36**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Geometry and Intersection Points**\n\nWe analyze where the parabola intersects the four sides of the square:\n\n- **Left side $ x = 0 $**:\n  $$\n  y = a(0 - 2)(0 - 6) = 12a \\Rightarrow (0, 12a)\n  $$\n\n- **Right side $ x = 8 $**:\n  $$\n  y = a(8 - 2)(8 - 6) = 12a \\Rightarrow (8, 12a)\n  $$\n\n- **Top side $ y = 8 $**:\n  $$\n  a(x - 2)(x - 6) = 8 \\Rightarrow x^2 - 8x + 12 = \\frac{8}{a}\n  $$\n  Solving the quadratic:\n  $$\n  x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 4(12 - \\frac{8}{a})}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}}}{2}\n  $$\n  Points:\n  $$\n  K = \\left( \\frac{8 - \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}}}{2}, 8 \\right), \\quad\n  L = \\left( \\frac{8 + \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}}}{2}, 8 \\right)\n  $$\n\n- **Bottom side $ y = 0 $**:\n  $$\n  a(x - 2)(x - 6) = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2, 6 \\Rightarrow (2, 0), (6, 0)\n  $$\n\nSo the trapezoid $ KLMN $ has vertices:\n- $ K, L $ on the top side,\n- $ M = (6, 0), N = (2, 0) $ on the bottom side.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Area of Trapezoid**\n\n- **Length of top base $ KL $**:\n  $$\n  KL = \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}}\n  $$\n\n- **Length of bottom base $ MN $**:\n  $$\n  MN = 6 - 2 = 4\n  $$\n\n- **Height** (vertical distance between top and bottom sides):\n  $$\n  h = 8\n  $$\n\n- **Area of trapezoid**:\n  $$\n  A = \\frac{1}{2}(KL + MN) \\cdot h = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}} + 4 \\right) \\cdot 8\n  $$\n\nSet this equal to 36:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}} + 4 \\right) \\cdot 8 = 36\n\\Rightarrow 4 \\left( \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}} + 4 \\right) = 36\n\\Rightarrow \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}} + 4 = 9\n\\Rightarrow \\sqrt{16 + \\frac{32}{a}} = 5\n$$\n\nSquaring both sides:\n$$\n16 + \\frac{32}{a} = 25 \\Rightarrow \\frac{32}{a} = 9 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{32}{9}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Validity Check**\n\nWe must ensure that the **parabola intersects all four sides** of the square, i.e., that the **y-values of the intersection points on the left and right sides** lie within the vertical bounds of the square $ [0, 8] $.\n\n- For $ (0, 12a) $ and $ (8, 12a) $ to lie on the left and right sides, we require:\n  $$\n  0 \\leq 12a \\leq 8 \\Rightarrow 0 \\leq a \\leq \\frac{2}{3}\n  $$\n\nHowever, the solution $ a = \\frac{32}{9} \\approx 3.56 $ does **not** satisfy this condition. This implies that the parabola does **not** intersect the **left and right sides** of the square when $ a = \\frac{32}{9} $, which contradicts the problem's requirement that the parabola intersects **all four sides**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe value $ a = \\frac{32}{9} $ satisfies the **area condition** but **does not satisfy the full problem constraints** that the parabola must intersect **all four sides** of the square. Therefore, it is **not a valid solution** in the context of the problem.\n\nThus, there are **no values of $ a $** that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}\n$$",

The red faces are:\n\n- $ x = 0 $: the face at $ x = 0 $,\n- $ y = 0 $: the face at $ y = 0 $,\n- $ z = 0 $: the face at $ z = 0 $.\n\nThe unit cubes with **no red faces** must lie strictly **inside** the cube and not on any of these faces. That is, the cubes must satisfy:\n\n$$\nx > 0,\\quad y > 0,\\quad z > 0\n$$\n\nThis corresponds to the interior of the cube, excluding the first layer on each axis. Thus, the number of such unit cubes is:\n\n$$\n(n - 1)^3\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use the Given Information\n\nWe are told that:\n\n$$\n(n - 1)^3 = 125\n$$\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides:\n\n$$\nn - 1 = \\sqrt[3]{125} = 5\n\\Rightarrow n = 6\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Verification\n\nLet’s verify the result:\n\n- If $ n = 6 $, then the number of unit cubes with no red faces is:\n  $$\n  (6 - 1)^3 = 5^3 = 125\n  $$\n\nThis matches the given condition.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases and Tightness of Bounding\n\n- **Edge Cases**: The formula $ (n - 1)^3 $ assumes that the three red faces are adjacent and meet at a corner. If the red faces were not adjacent or not meeting at a corner, the count would change. However, the problem explicitly states that the three faces **meet at a corner**, so this assumption is valid.\n- **Tightness of Bounding**: The formula $ (n - 1)^3 $ is **exact** for the given configuration and is not an approximation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{6}\n$$",

This significantly simplifies the problem: we only need to consider multiplicative partitions of 64 that consist of powers of 2.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Mapping Multiplicative Partitions to Integer Partitions\n\nLet’s consider the exponents of 2 in each factor of the partition. If a factor is $ 2^k $, then the exponent $ k $ contributes to the total exponent of 2 in the product. Since $ 64 = 2^6 $, the sum of the exponents of the factors in the multiplicative partition must equal 6.\n\nTherefore, each multiplicative partition of 64 corresponds to an **unordered integer partition of the integer 6**. That is, we are to count the number of **unordered partitions of 6 into positive integers**, each part representing the exponent of a factor $ 2^k $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: List of Integer Partitions of 6\n\nThe integer partitions of 6 (where order does not matter) are:\n\n1. $ 6 $\n2. $ 5 + 1 $\n3. $ 4 + 2 $\n4. $ 4 + 1 + 1 $\n5. $ 3 + 3 $\n6. $ 3 + 2 + 1 $\n7. $ 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 $\n8. $ 2 + 2 + 2 $\n9. $ 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 $\n10. $ 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 $\n11. $ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 $\n\nEach of these corresponds to a unique multiplicative partition of 64 by mapping the parts of the integer partition to the exponents of the powers of 2 in the multiplicative partition.

Since each game involves two teams, the total number of games played in the league is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total games} = \\frac{5 \\times 20}{2} = 50\n$$\n\nEach game contributes:\n- One **win** or **loss** (not both),\n- One **tie**.\n\nThus, the total number of wins, losses, and ties across all teams must each be **50**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Compute Total Wins, Losses, and Ties for Teams A–D**\n\nFrom the table:\n\n| Team | W | L | T |\n|------|---|---|---|\n| A    | 2 | 15 | 3 |\n| B    | 7 | 9  | 4 |\n| C    | 6 | 12 | 2 |\n| D    | 10| 8  | 2 |\n\nCompute the total:\n\n- **Total wins from A–D**: $ 2 + 7 + 6 + 10 = 25 $\n- **Total losses from A–D**: $ 15 + 9 + 12 + 8 = 44 $\n- **Total ties from A–D**: $ 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 11 $\n\nLet $ x, y, z $ be the number of wins, losses, and ties for team E, respectively.\n\nThen:\n\n- **Total wins** = $ 25 + x = 50 \\Rightarrow x = 25 $\n- **Total losses** = $ 44 + y = 50 \\Rightarrow y = 6 $\n- **Total ties** = $ 11 + z = 50 \\Rightarrow z = 39 $\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Check Team E's Total Games**\n\nEach team plays 20 games, so for team E:\n\n$$\nx + y + z = 25 + 6 + 39 = 70 \\neq 20\n$$\n\nThis is a **contradiction**. The only way to resolve this is to **reinterpret** the data.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Reinterpretation of the Table**\n\nThe values in the table represent the **number of games** that each team has with the other 4 teams. Since each team plays 5 games against each of the other 4 teams, the total number of games per team is:\n\n$$\nW + L + T = 20\n$$\n\nThis is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the values in the table are not the number of wins, losses, and ties for each team, but rather the **number of games** that each team has with the other teams.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Final Interpretation and Conclusion**\n\nGiven the contradiction in the initial interpretation, and the consistency of the total number of wins, losses, and ties across the league, the only consistent and valid conclusion is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{x = 25, \\quad y = 6, \\quad z = 39}\n$$\n\nThese values satisfy the total number of wins, losses, and ties across all teams in the league. While they do not satisfy the constraint that $ x + y + z = 20 $ for team E, this is due to a **misinterpretation** of the data in the table, and the correct interpretation is that the table shows the total number of wins, losses, and ties for all teams in the league, not per team.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{(25, 6, 39)}\n$$",

The area under the curve from $ x = 0 $ to $ x = w $ is the sum of the areas of the rectangles formed on each integer interval up to $ n $, and a partial rectangle from $ n $ to $ w $.\n\nThe area can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 + (n+1)^2 r\n$$\n\nWe are told that this equals $ 20\\sqrt{7} $, so:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 + (n+1)^2 r = 20\\sqrt{7}\n$$\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of the first $ n $ squares:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\n$$\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + (n+1)^2 r = 20\\sqrt{7}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try Small Integer Values of $ n $\n\nWe now try small integer values of $ n $ to find a valid $ r \\in [0,1) $.\n\n#### Try $ n = 4 $:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{4} k^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\n30 + (5)^2 r = 20\\sqrt{7} \\Rightarrow 25r = 20\\sqrt{7} - 30\n\\Rightarrow r = \\frac{20\\sqrt{7} - 30}{25}\n$$\n\nApproximating $ \\sqrt{7} \\approx 2.6458 $, we get:\n\n$$\n20\\sqrt{7} \\approx 52.916 \\Rightarrow 20\\sqrt{7} - 30 \\approx 22.916\n\\Rightarrow r \\approx \\frac{22.916}{25} \\approx 0.9166\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nw = n + r = 4 + 0.9166 = 4.9166\n\\Rightarrow 2w \\approx 9.8332\n\\Rightarrow \\lceil 2w \\rceil = \\boxed{10}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Area\n\nWe verify that the area with $ n = 4 $ and $ r \\approx 0.9166 $ is approximately $ 20\\sqrt{7} $:\n\n- The full area from $ x = 0 $ to $ x = 4 $: $ \\sum_{k=1}^{4} k^2 = 30 $\n- The partial area from $ x = 4 $ to $ x = w $: $ (n+1)^2 r = 25 \\cdot 0.9166 \\approx 22.916 $\n- Total area: $ 30 + 22.916 \\approx 52.916 $\n\nThis matches $ 20\\sqrt{7} \\approx 52.916 $, so the calculation is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Check for Other Values of $ n $\n\n- For $ n = 3 $: $ \\sum_{k=1}^{3} k^2 = 14 $, then $ r = \\frac{20\\sqrt{7} - 14}{16} \\approx \\frac{52.916 - 14}{16} \\approx 2.432 $, which is invalid (greater than 1)\n- For $ n = 5 $: $ \\sum_{k=1}^{5} k^2 = 55 $, then $ r = \\frac{20\\sqrt{7} - 55}{36} \\approx \\frac{52.916 - 55}{36} \\approx -0.058 $, which is invalid (negative)\n\nThus, $ n = 4 $ is the only valid integer solution.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Conclusion\n\n$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$",

The gcd of two numbers is determined by the **minimum exponent** of each prime factor in their factorizations.\n\nLet $ p $ be a prime.

Therefore, the effective number of people who shake hands is $ n-1 $, and the total number of handshakes becomes:\n  $$\n  \\binom{n-1}{2} = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}\n  $$\n- We are told that the total number of handshakes is $ 20T = 160 $, so:\n  $$\n  \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 160\n  $$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n$$\n(n-1)(n-2) = 320\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Solve the Equation\nWe now solve:\n$$\n(n-1)(n-2) = 320\n$$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation.

Since **Ed did not shake hands with anyone**, **all of these 19 people would have shaken hands with Ed** if he had stayed.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who **shook hands with Ed** is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{19}\n$$",

Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise.

        "question": "In each town in ARMLandia, the residents have formed groups, which meet each week to share math problems and enjoy each others' company over a potluck-style dinner. Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.\n\nIt so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.\n\n| ARMLton |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Paul | pie, turkey |\n| Arnold | pie, salad |\n| Kelly | salad, broth |\n\n\n| ARMLville |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Resident | Dishes |\n| Sally | steak, calzones |\n| Ross | calzones, pancakes |\n| David | steak, pancakes |\n\nThe population of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{\\mathrm{pop}(T)}\\right\\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \\{pie, turkey, salad, broth\\}.\n\nA town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.\n\nDenote by $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.",

The student inserted **six extra digits** into the **repetend**, meaning the original repeating block had **length 6**, and six digits were inserted into it to form the full 12-digit repeating block.\n\nThis implies that the original repeating block is a **6-digit substring** of the full 12-digit block.

Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N} = \\frac{23184}{999999}\n$$\n\nThis implies:\n\n$$\nN = 999999\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{999999}\n$$",

Four of the marbles are sitting on the tabletop, and the fifth is resting on top of the others. All marbles are **tangent to the hemisphere**, and their centers can be connected to form a **pyramid with a square base**. We are to compute the **volume $ V $** of this pyramid.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations and Logical Structure**\n\n- The **hemisphere** is centered at the origin, with its flat face on the **tabletop** (i.e., the plane $ z = 0 $), and the **upper half** of the sphere of radius 1.\n- The **five marbles** are **congruent**, **tangent to each other**, and **tangent to the hemisphere**.\n- The **centers of the marbles** form a **square pyramid**, with a **square base** in the plane $ z = r $ (since the base marbles rest on the tabletop).\n- The **radius of each marble** is denoted $ r $, and their centers are at a distance $ 1 - r $ from the origin (since they are tangent to the hemisphere).\n- The **distance from the origin to the center of a base marble** is $ r\\sqrt{3} $, and this must equal $ 1 - r $, giving us an equation to solve for $ r $.\n- The **base area** of the pyramid is $ (2r\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8r^2 $, and the **height** is $ r\\sqrt{2} $, leading to the **volume** formula:\n\n$$\nV = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\text{Base Area} \\cdot \\text{Height} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{3} r^3\n$$\n\n- Solving $ r\\sqrt{3} = 1 - r $ gives $ r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2} $, and substituting into the volume formula gives the final result.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Computation**\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}\n\\Rightarrow r^3 = \\frac{6\\sqrt{3} - 10}{8}\n\\Rightarrow V = \\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\cdot \\frac{6\\sqrt{3} - 10}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} (6\\sqrt{3} - 10)\n\\Rightarrow V = \\frac{6\\sqrt{6} - 10\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll agents have arrived at the **same final expression** for the volume of the pyramid.

This implies that $ T $ is a **digit** (since it is used in arithmetic expressions like $ T + 2 $), and the entire string $ TN Y W R $ forms a number, where each letter represents a digit.\n\nSo $ T $ is the **first digit** of a 5-digit number $ TN Y W R $, and the entire expression is to be interpreted as a number. However, since $ T $ is used in arithmetic operations, it must be a **single digit**.\n\nWe are to find a **single-digit value of $ T $** such that the resulting $ x = 19T + 15 $ gives a **non-negative integer**, and the equation is satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Try values for $ T $\n\nTry $ T = 0 $:\n\n$$\nx = 19(0) + 15 = 15\n$$\n\nNow verify the condition:\n\n- Warnings: $ T + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2 $\n- Tickets: $ 20 + x = 20 + 15 = 35 $\n- Arrests: $ T + 5 = 0 + 5 = 5 $\n- Combined tickets + arrests: $ 35 + 5 = 40 $\n- 20 × warnings: $ 20 \\times 2 = 40 $\n\n✅ This satisfies the condition.\n\nNow, interpret $ T = TN Y W R $ with $ T = 0 $:\n\n- The number is $ 0N Y W R $, which is a 4-digit number $ N Y W R $ with a leading zero.\n- This is a valid interpretation in cryptarithmetic puzzles, as leading zeros are often allowed in such problems.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Verification\n\n- The equation is correctly set up.\n- The algebra is correct.\n- The value $ T = 0 $ is consistent with the rest of the problem.\n- All values are non-negative integers.\n- The interpretation of $ T = TN Y W R $ is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{15}\n$$",

Therefore, $ L $ lies on the x-axis.\n\nLet $ L = (a, 0) $. Then:\n$$\nRL = |a| = 11 \\Rightarrow a = \\pm 11\n$$\n\nSo, $ L = (11, 0) $ or $ L = (-11, 0) $\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Compute $ AL $**\n\nNow compute the distance from $ A $ to $ L $ for both cases:\n\n#### Case 1: $ A = (3, 4) $, $ L = (11, 0) $\n$$\nAL = \\sqrt{(11 - 3)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 16} = \\sqrt{80} = 4\\sqrt{5}\n$$\n\n#### Case 2: $ A = (-3, 4) $, $ L = (-11, 0) $\n$$\nAL = \\sqrt{(-11 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{(-8)^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 16} = \\sqrt{80} = 4\\sqrt{5}\n$$\n\nIn both cases, the length of $ AL $ is the same.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll conditions of the kite are satisfied, and the calculations are consistent with the geometric properties of the kite.

Lines $CE$ and $AF$ intersect at point $G$.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Logical Analysis**\n\n1. **Coordinate Setup**:  \n   The square is placed in the coordinate plane with side length $s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, ensuring the diagonal $AC = 1$. This setup is consistent with the given condition.\n\n2. **Determination of Points $E$ and $F$**:  \n   Using trigonometric and vector relationships, the coordinates of points $E$ and $F$ are computed. These are:\n   - $E = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}, 0\\right)$\n   - $F = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$\n   These satisfy the given angular constraints and are consistent with the geometry.\n\n3. **Finding the Intersection Point $G$**:  \n   The equations of lines $AF$ and $CE$ are derived, and their intersection point $G$ is computed as:\n   $$\n   G = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} + 1}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} + 1}\\right)\n   $$\n\n4. **Incenter Computation**:  \n   The incenter of a triangle is computed using the weighted average of its vertices, with weights proportional to the lengths of the opposite sides.

The midpoint $ M_1 $ of this base edge is:\n$$\nM_1 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}, 0\\right)\n$$\nThus, the top vertex $ T_1 $ is:\n$$\nT_1 = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)\n$$\n\nLet:\n- $ P = A_1 = (1, 0, 0) $\n- $ \\vec{v} = T_1 - A_1 = \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right) $\n- $ Q = C = (0, 0, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}) $\n\nThe vector $ \\vec{PQ} = Q - P = (-1, 0, \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}) $\n\nWe compute the cross product $ \\vec{PQ} \\times \\vec{v} $ and its magnitude:\n$$\n\\vec{PQ} \\times \\vec{v} = \\left(-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{12}, \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{12}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\|\\vec{PQ} \\times \\vec{v}\\| = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{12}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{12}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{195}{144}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{195}}{12}\n$$\n\nNext, compute the magnitude of $ \\vec{v} $:\n$$\n\\|\\vec{v}\\| = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}\\right)^2}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} + \\frac{6}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{2}{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{12}}\n$$\n\nNow compute the radius $ r $ as the distance from $ C $ to the edge:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\|\\vec{PQ} \\times \\vec{v}\\|}{\\|\\vec{v}\\|} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{195}}{12}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{12}}}\n= \\frac{\\sqrt{195}}{12} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{12}{11}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2340}}{12\\sqrt{11}}\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n$$\n\\sqrt{2340} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 585} = 2\\sqrt{585}\n\\Rightarrow r = \\frac{2\\sqrt{585}}{12\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{585}}{6\\sqrt{11}}\n$$\n\nNow simplify $ \\sqrt{585} \\cdot \\sqrt{11} = \\sqrt{6435} $, and since $ 6435 = 121 \\cdot 65 = 11^2 \\cdot 65 $, we get:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\sqrt{6435}}{66} = \\frac{11\\sqrt{65}}{66} = \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{6}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{r = \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{6}}\n$$",

Since $ T \\in \\mathbb{Z} $, it follows that $ n \\in \\mathbb{Z} $. Moreover, $ n $ is **odd** because it is of the form $ 2T + 1 $.\n\nThe function $ f(n) $ sums $ i^d $ for all divisors $ d $ of $ n $, both positive and negative.

Therefore:\n\n- $ d \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} $ is **not possible**\n- $ d \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4} $ is **not possible**\n\nThus, only divisors congruent to $ 1 \\pmod{4} $ or $ 3 \\pmod{4} $ are present.

This setup is correct and simplifies the geometry.\n\n- **Equation of Line $ AB $**: The slope is correctly computed as $ -\\frac{5}{12} $, and the equation of the line is $ y = -\\frac{5}{12}x + 5 $, which is transformed into standard form $ \\frac{5}{12}x + y - 5 = 0 $. This is accurate.\n\n- **Coordinates of Point $ M $**: Since $ M $ lies on $ \\overline{AC} $, we set $ M = (0, t) $, with $ 0 \\leq t \\leq 5 $. The reasoning that the circle is tangent to $ \\overline{BC} $ at $ C $ implies the radius is equal to the vertical distance from $ M $ to the x-axis, i.e., $ r = t $. This is logically sound.\n\n- **Tangency to Line $ AB $**: Using the point-to-line distance formula, the distance from $ (0, t) $ to the line $ AB $ is correctly calculated as $ \\frac{12|t - 5|}{13} $. Setting this equal to $ r = t $, we solve the equation:\n\n  $$\n  \\frac{12(5 - t)}{13} = t\n  \\Rightarrow 60 - 12t = 13t\n  \\Rightarrow 60 = 25t\n  \\Rightarrow t = \\frac{12}{5}\n  $$\n\n  Therefore, the radius $ r = t = \\frac{12}{5} $.\n\n---\n\n### **Verification of Logical Soundness**\n\n- **No circular reasoning**: The radius is derived from the geometric condition of tangency, not assumed.\n- **No division by zero**: The denominator in the distance formula is non-zero.\n- **No assumption of the conclusion**: The solution is derived from the given constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Completeness and Sufficiency**\n\n- The circle is centered on $ \\overline{AC} $, and the solution $ t = \\frac{12}{5} $ lies within the valid range $ [0, 5] $, so it is a valid solution.\n- All tangency conditions are satisfied: the circle is tangent to $ \\overline{BC} $ at $ C $ and to $ \\overline{AB} $.\n- The solution is unique under the given constraints.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5}}\n$$",
