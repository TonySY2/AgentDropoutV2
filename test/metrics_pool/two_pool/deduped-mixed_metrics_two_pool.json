Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and centre $A$ of circle $O$. Let the center of this circle be $P$.\nNow, $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle. Moreover, since $AD$ is the only chord, $BC$ must be tangent to the circle $P$.\nThe rest of this problem is straightforward.\nOur goal is to find $\\sin \\angle AOB = \\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)}$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. We have $BM=3$ and $OM=4$. Let $R$ be the projection of $A$ onto $OM$, and similarly let $Q$ be the projection of $P$ onto $OM$. Then it remains to find $AR$ so that we can use the addition formula for $\\sin$.\nAs $PN$ is a radius of circle $P$, $PN=2.5$, and similarly, $PO=2.5$. Since $OM=4$, we have $OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5$. Thus $PQ=\\sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2$.\nFurther, we see that $\\triangle OAR$ is a dilation of $\\triangle OPQ$ about center $O$ with scale factor $2$, so $AR=2PQ=4$.\nLastly, we apply the formula:\\[\\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)} = \\sin \\angle AOM \\cos \\angle BOM - \\sin \\angle BOM \\cos \\angle AOM = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)=\\frac{7}{25}\\]Thus the answer is $7\\cdot25=\\boxed{175}$."

After doing a little bit of algebra, the intersections are the lines $y = -2x + 10$, $y = -2x + 50$, $y = 2z + 10$, and $z = x + 5$. Thus, there are three more vertices on the polygon, which are at $(0,10,0)(0,20,5)(15,20,20)$.\nWe can find the lengths of the sides of the polygons now. There are 4 right triangles with legs of length 5 and 10, so their hypotenuses are $5\\sqrt{5}$. The other two are of $45-45-90 \\triangle$s with legs of length 15, so their hypotenuses are $15\\sqrt{2}$. So we have a hexagon with sides $15\\sqrt{2},5\\sqrt{5}, 5\\sqrt{5},15\\sqrt{2}, 5\\sqrt{5},5\\sqrt{5}$ By symmetry, we know that opposite angles of the polygon are congruent.

This means there are $(84)(1)(60)=5040$ arrangements.\nCase 3: For four and five, there are $\\dbinom{9}{5}=126$ sets for the rings. Within the five, there are $\\dfrac{4!}{2}=12$, and within the four there are $\\dfrac{3!}{2}=3$ arrangements. This means the total is $(126)(12)(3)=4536$.\nCase 4: For the nine case, there is $\\dbinom{9}{9}=1$ arrangement for the ring. Within it, there are $\\dfrac{8!}{2}=20160$ arrangements.\nSumming the cases, we have $280+5040+4536+20160=30016 \\to \\boxed{16}$."

More precisely, since $a_i \\le 6$ for each $i$, then we have the following loose bound from the geometric series formula\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= (16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \\cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d \\\\\n&\\ge (16^d - 1) + (1 - 7) \\cdot 6 + \\cdots + (1-7^d) \\cdot 6 \\\\\n&= 16^d + d - 6 \\cdot \\frac{7^{d+1} - 1}{7 - 1} \\\\\n&\\ge 16^d - 7^{d+1} \\\\\n\\end{align*}For $d = 3$, then $16^3 = 4096 > 7^4 = 2401$, and by induction, $16^d > 7^{d+1}$ for all $d \\ge 3$. Thus, $d \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$. If $d = 0$, then all values will work, namely $n = 1,2,3,4,5,6$. If $d = 1$, then $$(16 - 1)a_0 + (1-7)a_1 = 15a_0 - 6a_1 = 3(5a_0 - 2a_1) = 0.$$Thus, $5a_0 = 2a_1$, so $5$ divides into $a_1$. As $a_1 \\le 6$, then $a_1 = 0,5$, but the former yields that $n = 0$. Thus, we discard it, giving us the number $n = 52_7 = 5 \\cdot 7 + 2 = 37$. For $d=2$, we obtain that $$(256 - 1)a_0 + (16 - 7)a_1 + (1 - 49)a_2 = 3(51a_0 + 3a_1 - 16a_2) = 0.$$Since $16a_2 \\le 6 \\cdot 16 = 96$, then $a_0 = 1$. Then, $51 + 3a_1 = 3(17 + a_1) = 16a_2$, so it follows that $a_2$ is divisible by $3$. Thus, $a_2 = 0,3,6$, but only $a_2 = 6$ is large enough. This yields that $a_1 = 15$, which is not possible in base $7$. Thus, the sum of the numbers satisfying the problem statement is equal to $1+2+3+4+5+6+37 = \\boxed{58}.$"

Now when we change the height of one of the bricks, we either add $0$ inches, $6$ inches, or $15$ inches to the height. Now all we need to do is to find the different change values we can get from $94$ $0$'s, $6$'s, and $15$'s. Because $0$, $6$, and $15$ are all multiples of $3$, the change will always be a multiple of $3$, so we just need to find the number of changes we can get from $0$'s, $2$'s, and $5$'s.\nFrom here, we count what we can get:\n\\[0, 2 = 2, 4 = 2+2, 5 = 5, 6 = 2+2+2, 7 = 5+2, 8 = 2+2+2+2, 9 = 5+2+2, \\ldots\\]\nIt seems we can get every integer greater or equal to four; we can easily deduce this by considering parity or using the Chicken McNugget Theorem, which says that the greatest number that cannot be expressed in the form of $2m + 5n$ for $m,n$ being positive integers is $5 \\times 2 - 5 - 2=3$.\nBut we also have a maximum change ($94 \\times 5$), so that will have to stop somewhere. To find the gaps, we can work backwards as well. From the maximum change, we can subtract either $0$'s, $3$'s, or $5$'s. The maximum we can't get is $5 \\times 3-5-3=7$, so the numbers $94 \\times 5-8$ and below, except $3$ and $1$, work. Now there might be ones that we haven't counted yet, so we check all numbers between $94 \\times 5-8$ and $94 \\times 5$. $94 \\times 5-7$ obviously doesn't work, $94 \\times 5-6$ does since 6 is a multiple of 3, $94 \\times 5-5$ does because it is a multiple of $5$ (and $3$), $94 \\times 5-4$ doesn't since $4$ is not divisible by $5$ or $3$, $94 \\times 5-3$ does since $3=3$, and $94 \\times 5-2$ and $94 \\times 5-1$ don't, and $94 \\times 5$ does.\nThus the numbers $0$, $2$, $4$ all the way to $94 \\times 5-8$, $94 \\times 5-6$, $94 \\times 5-5$, $94 \\times 5-3$, and $94\\times 5$ work. That's $2+(94 \\times 5 - 8 - 4 +1)+4=\\boxed{465}$ numbers."

Its endpoints are $\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i$ and $\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i.$  We can check that this arc is $120^\\circ.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize (4 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, P, Q;\npath foo;\nreal t;\n\nA = 1/sqrt(3)*dir(30);\nB = 1/sqrt(3)*dir(30 - 60);\nC = 1/sqrt(3)*dir(30 - 2*60);\nD = 1/sqrt(3)*dir(30 - 3*60);\nE = 1/sqrt(3)*dir(30 - 4*60);\nF = 1/sqrt(3)*dir(30 - 5*60);\n\nt = 1/(2*sqrt(3));\nfoo = (1/2/(1/4 + t^2),-t/(1/4 + t^2));\nQ = (1/2/(1/4 + t^2),-t/(1/4 + t^2));\n\nt = -1/(2*sqrt(3));\nfoo = (1/2/(1/4 + t^2),-t/(1/4 + t^2));\nP = (1/2/(1/4 + t^2),-t/(1/4 + t^2));\n\nfor (t = -1/(2*sqrt(3)); t <= 1/(2*sqrt(3)); t = t + 0.01) {\n  foo = foo--(1/2/(1/4 + t^2),-t/(1/4 + t^2));\n}\n\ndraw(foo,red);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--cycle);\ndraw((-1,0)--(2.5,0));\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,1));\ndraw((1,0)--P,dashed);\ndraw((1,0)--Q,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$\\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i$\", Q, S);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i$\", P, N);\n\ndot(\"$\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{i}{2 \\sqrt{3}}$\", (1/2,1/(2*sqrt(3))), dir(0));\ndot(\"$\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{i}{2 \\sqrt{3}}$\", (1/2,-1/(2*sqrt(3))), dir(0));\ndot(P,red);\ndot(Q,red);\ndot(\"$1$\", (1,0), SW);\n[/asy]\n\nBy symmetry, the rest of the boundary of $S$ can be obtain by rotating this arc by multiples of $60^\\circ.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npath foo = arc((1,0),1,-60,60);\nint i;\n\nfor (i = 0; i <= 5; ++i) {\n  draw(rotate(60*i)*(foo),red);\n\tdraw(rotate(60*i)*(((1,0) + dir(-60))--(1,0)--((1,0) + dir(60))));\n\tdot(rotate(60*i)*((1,0)));\n  draw(rotate(60*i)*((0,0)--(1,0)--dir(60)));\n}\n\nfor (i = 0; i <= 5; ++i) {\n\tdot(rotate(60*i)*((1,0) + dir(60)),red);\n}\n[/asy]\n\nWe can divide $S$ into 12 equilateral triangles with side length 1, and six $120^\\circ$-sectors with radius 1, so the area of $S$ is\n\\[12 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\pi = \\boxed{3 \\sqrt{3} + 2 \\pi}.\\]Here are some alternative ways to derive the arc of the circle:\n\nAlternative 1: Let $w = \\frac{1}{z},$ where the real part of $z$ is $\\frac{1}{2}.$  Write $w = r \\operatorname{cis} \\theta.$  Then\n\\[\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{w} = \\frac{1}{r \\operatorname{cis} \\theta} = \\frac{1}{r} \\operatorname{cis} (-\\theta) = \\frac{\\cos \\theta - i \\sin \\theta}{r},\\]so $\\frac{\\cos \\theta}{r} = \\frac{1}{2},$ or $r = 2 \\cos \\theta.$\n\nIf $x + yi = w = r \\operatorname{cis} \\theta = r \\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta,$ then\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = r^2 = 2r \\cos \\theta = 2x,\\]so $(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1.$\n\nAlternative 2: Let $w = \\frac{1}{z},$ where the real part of $z$ is $\\frac{1}{2}.$  Then $z$ is equidistant from 0 and 1 (the line $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ is the perpendicular bisector of 0 and 1), so\n\\[|z| = |z - 1|.\\]Dividing both sides by $z,$ we get\n\\[\\left| 1 - \\frac{1}{z} \\right| = 1,\\]so $|w - 1| = 1.$  Thus, $w$ lies on the circle centered at 1 with radius 1."
